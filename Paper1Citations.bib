               <jats:p>
                  <jats:italic>Study aim</jats:italic>: The functional assessment of patients after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is one of the key points in deciding whether one can safely return to physical activity. The aim of this study is to investigate the usefulness of the NEURAC® tests and single leg balance test (SLBT) in the functional evaluation of adolescent patients after ACLR to detect differences between the operated and non-operated extremity.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>
                  <jats:italic>Material and methods</jats:italic>: A total of 31 physically active, adolescent patients (mean age: 15.7 ± 1.4 years) who underwent primary single-bundle ACLR using the autogenous semitendinosus-gracilis tendon graft were evaluated using the NEURAC® and SLBT tests (mean time from surgery to examination was 6.6 ± 1.0 months). All patients were operated on by the same surgeon, and postoperative physiotherapy was carried out using a standardized protocol.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>
                  <jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>: Only one of the NEURAC® tests showed significant differences between the operated and non-operated extremities: prone bridging (3.58º vs. 3.97º, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0.01). Several weak and moderate, significant correlations between NEURAC® and SLBT tests were observed in the operated (r from –0.42 to 0.37) and non-operated (r from –0.37 to –0.43) extremities</jats:p>
               <jats:p>
                  <jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>: The NEURAC® tests in comparison to SLBT seems to be more effective for detecting functional differences between the operated and non-operated extremity in adolescent patients about 6 months post-ACLR. Correlations between the outcomes of the NEURAC® tests and SLBT are not clear.</jats:p>

TI  - Quantifying anterior knee pain during specific activities after using the bone-patellar tendon-bone graft for arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Background/objective There has been much debate about the optimal graft choice for an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Anterior knee pain is a common donor site problem when using a bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) graft. However, knowledge of the characteristics of anterior knee pain during different daily activities is still limited. This study aimed to determine the incidence of anterior knee pain and to quantify the degree of pain during a range of daily living activities. Methods Thirty-five patients who were scheduled to undergo an ACL reconstruction with an autologous BPTB graft between February 2015 and December 2016 were enrolled. A visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain was recorded during each of the following activities: ascending at 30-degree slope, ascending and descending stairs, running, jumping, squatting, kneeling, sitting cross-legged, and sitting one-legged. Demographic data, the range of motion, the area of decreased sensation, and the IKDC score were collected and compared 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Results The 35 male patients had a mean age of 29.7 years. Postoperatively, the mean IKDC scores were 58.1 ± 9.8 at 3 months and 72.7 ± 10.5 at 6 months. The incidences of overall anterior knee pain were 62.9% and 34.3% at the 3- and 6-month time points. Kneeling was the only activity that produced severe pain. At 3 months postoperatively, kneeling's mean VAS pain score was 3.9 ± 2.9 (2.9, 4.9; 95% CI for mean for 17 patients [48.5%] with considerable pain), whereas at 6 months postoperatively, it was 2 ± 2.5 (1.2–2.9; 95% CI for mean for 9 patients [25.7%] with considerable pain). The area of numbness of the proximal leg decreased from 12.8 ± 18.3 cm2 (6.4, 19.2; 95% CI for mean) to 3.2 ± 9.1 cm2 (0.1, 6.5; 95% CI for mean) at 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Conclusions Kneeling was the most challenging activity in terms of creating considerable levels of anterior knee pain in patients who had undergone an ACL reconstruction using a BPTB graft. Other knee activities, however, did not create moderate or severe degrees of anterior knee pain. Both anterior knee pain and numbness at the proximal leg improved over time. Trial registration number: TCTR2018–0630002.

TI  - Functional Anterior Knee Pain and Return to Sport Following Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <b>Background:</b> Bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is a frequently used technique but has been associated with a high incidence of postoperative anterior knee pain. However, previous studies have not evaluated if this anterior knee pain is functionally limiting for patients. This study introduces the concept of functional anterior knee pain, or kneecap pain that limits patients' ability to return to their prior level of activity or sport. <b>Methods:</b> We reviewed BPTB ACL reconstructions from April 2013 to May 2017. Patients included in the analysis had a minimum of 1 year of clinical follow-up and 3 years of survey follow-up. Statistical analyses were performed using paired <i>t</i> tests and binomial test. <b>Results:</b> Sixty-seven patients met the inclusion criteria. Compared to the mean preoperative visual analog scale (VAS) pain score of 6.1, patients reported statistically significant reductions in VAS scores at 1 year and 3 years postoperatively to 0.9 and 1.8, respectively (<i>P</i><0.01). The incidence (28.4%) of anterior knee pain was highest at the 3-month time point. This incidence decreased to 6.0% at 1 year and 7.5% at 3 years postoperatively. At 3 years postoperatively, 94% (63/67) of the patients in this study were not limited by functional anterior knee pain and returned to preoperative levels of activity and sport. <b>Conclusion:</b> To our knowledge, this investigation is the first to define and quantify the relationship between postoperative anterior knee pain and resultant functional limitations. This study shows that ACL reconstruction with BPTB autograft was not significantly associated with functional anterior knee pain in our population and that the incidence of postoperative anterior knee pain following BPTB ACL reconstruction may be less than previously reported.

TI  - Hamstring Autograft Size Can Be Predicted and Is a Potential Risk Factor for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Failure
PY  - 2014
AB  - Purpose The purposes of this systematic review were (1) to determine whether there is a minimum hamstring autograft size for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction that significantly decreases the risk of failure and (2) to evaluate the methods to accurately and reliably predict the size of hamstring grafts. Methods We performed a systematic review of Level III and IV studies using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. All studies assessing failure of quadrupled-strand autograft hamstring ACL reconstruction as a function of graft diameter with at least 1 year of follow-up and those that assessed the use of imaging or anthropometric patient-specific factors to predict hamstring autograft size were included. Results We identified 4 clinical studies that directly compared graft size and failure rate. These correlated with a 6.8 times greater relative risk of failure if the graft diameter was equal to or less than 8 mm ( P  = .008). All 9 anthropometric-based prediction studies were able to significantly correlate at least 1 parameter with intraoperative graft size. Height was the most common correlation, with r  = 0.45 ( P r  = 0.66 ( P Conclusions On the basis of the available evidence, ACL reconstruction with a quadrupled-strand hamstring autograft with a diameter equal to or larger than 8 mm decreases failure rates. In addition, grafts larger than 8 mm decrease failure rates in patients aged younger than 20 years, a group identified to be at increased risk of failure. Both patient height and magnetic resonance imaging–derived cross-sectional area of the hamstring tendons can be used preoperatively to reliably predict the hamstring autograft diameter. Level of Evidence Level IV, systematic review of Level III and IV studies.

TI  - CRITERION-BASED REHABILITATION PROGRAM WITH RETURN TO SPORT TESTING FOLLOWING ACL RECONSTRUCTION: A CASE SERIES
PY  - 2020
AB  - Background Less than 50% of those sustaining an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury return to their preinjury level of sports participation or participate in competitive sport at two to seven years post ACL reconstruction (ACLR). After ACLR, it has been reported that frequency of subsequent ACL tears has reached as high as 31%. Purpose The purpose of this case series was to evaluate return to sport and reinjury rates following the use of a criterion-based rehabilitation protocol with a final return to sport test that utilizes minimal equipment following ACL reconstruction. Study design Case series. Methods Following ACL reconstruction, participants were included if they had a goal of returning to their pre-injury sport or level of activity, were between 16 and 50 years of age at the time of evaluation, had at least 25 physical therapy visits covered by insurance, and planned to complete physical therapy until clearance for return to sport. Results Forty-three participants met the inclusion criteria and enrolled in the study. Twenty-one participants completed the full course of rehabilitation including passing their return to sport test and nineteen participants completed the two-year follow-up. Data obtained at two years indicated that 84% were able to return to their preinjury level of sports competition. A smaller percentage (16%) were able to return to a reduced level of sport and only one participant reported a second ACL injury. Conclusion Participants that completed the full course of rehabilitation and passed return to sport testing had a larger percentage that were able to return to preinjury participation levels than currently reported in the literature. This case series did not exclude participants based on graft type, single vs double bundle procedure, ACL revision surgeries, nor concomitant procedures or injuries. Level of evidence Level 4.

TI  - The knee adduction moment in hamstring and patellar tendon anterior cruciate ligament reconstructed knees
PY  - 2011
AB  - Purpose
The external knee adduction moment during gait has previously been associated with knee osteoarthritis, and although it has been shown to be greater following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery compared to a control group, it has not been compared between different graft types. Given that the incidence of radiographic knee osteoarthritis appears to be greater following patellar tendon compared to hamstring tendon ACL reconstruction, this study tested the hypothesis that the knee adduction moment would also be increased following patellar tendon ACL reconstruction.

TI  - Hip and Knee Kinematics and Kinetics During Landing Tasks After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Objective:  To evaluate the current evidence concerning kinematic and kinetic strategies adopted during dynamic landing tasks by patients with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Data Sources:  PubMed, Web of Science. Study Selection:  Original research articles that evaluated kinematics or kinetics (or both) during a landing task in those with a history of ACLR were included. Data Extraction:  Methodologic quality was assessed using the modified Downs and Black checklist. Means and standard deviations for knee or hip (or both) kinematics and kinetics were used to calculate Cohen d effect sizes and corresponding 95% confidence intervals between the injured limb of ACLR participants and contralateral or healthy matched limbs. Data were further stratified by landing tasks, either double- or single-limb landing. A random-effects–model meta-analysis was used to calculate pooled effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals. Data Synthesis:  The involved limbs of ACLR patients demonstrated clinically...

TI  - Investigation of Hamstring Tendon Graft Fixation for the Reconstruction of Anterior Cruciate Ligament using Interference Screw Merely or in Combination with Supplementary Staple: A Clinical Trial.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Background: Hamstring graft tendon for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is a common approach worldwide. Tibial side graft fixation to achieve appropriate stability is a serious concern, worldwide. The current study aims to compare the outcomes of mere use of interference screw for fixation of hamstring tendon graft versus the use of interference screw plus supplementary staple. Materials and Methods: This is a randomized clinical trial conducted on 53 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction from 2016 to 2018. The study population was randomly divided into two groups: graft fixation with interference screw only and interference screw plus supplementary staple. Postoperative recovery time, postoperative clinical examinations, and the scale of the International Knee Documentation Committee were assessed for participants and compared between two groups. Results: Comparison of two groups regarding demographic information, including age, gender distribution, postoperative recovery time, and body mass index, showed no statistical difference (P > 0.05). Postoperative Pivot test was insignificantly positive in 4 (16.7%) cases of screw interference with supplementary staple while it was positive in 3 (10.7%) cases with screw interference only approach (P = 0.98). IKCD index was not statistically different between two groups postoperatively (P = 0.72), while IKCD scores changed significantly following the surgical procedure, regardless of the type of the surgical procedure (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Use of supplementary staple beside interference screw was as successful as mere use of interference screw for fixation of hamstring tendon autologous graft of the ACL reconstruction, regarding force withstanding. The comparison of the two approaches revealed no remarkable difference.

TI  - Vertical jump impulse deficits persist from six to nine months after ACL reconstruction
PY  - 2021
AB  - Later-stage rehabilitation following ACL reconstruction (ACLR) provides a valuable opportunity to target performance deficits before return to sport. This study aimed to: 1) evaluate bilateral counter-movement jump (CMJ) phase-specific impulse and isokinetic strength inter-limb asymmetry progression from six to nine months post-ACLR; and 2) examine the extent to which individual changes in strength asymmetry could explain changes in impulse asymmetry. Male athletes (n=44) with a hamstring tendon or bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft were tested six and nine months post-ACLR. Two-way mixed-model ANOVAs were used to identify inter-session and inter-graft differences in CMJ phase-specific impulse asymmetries and knee isokinetic flexor and extensor strength asymmetries, as well as in absolute impulse and strength values of independent (ACLR/uninvolved) limbs. Linear regression models were used to assess the relationship between changes in impulse asymmetry and strength asymmetry. Reductions in strength asymmetry arose from improved ACLR-limb performance, whereas concentric impulse asymmetry reduced consequent to decreased uninvolved-limb performance and eccentric deceleration impulses decreased bilaterally. Graft type did not modulate findings. Changes in strength asymmetry had little or no ability to explain changes in impulse asymmetry. Consideration of approaches which may influence persisting deficits observed bi-laterally throughout vertical jumping performance post-ACLR may enhance rehabilitation practice.

TI  - Prevention of injury-related knee osteoarthritis: opportunities for the primary and secondary prevention of knee osteoarthritis
PY  - 2010
AB  - Where risk factors have been identified in knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA), with few exceptions, no prevention strategies have proven beneficial. The major risk factors for knee OA are advanced age, injury and obesity. However, there is limited or no evidence that they are modifiable or to what degree modifying them is effective in preventing development of knee OA or in preventing symptoms and progressive disease in persons with early OA. The notable exception is the growing epidemic of (sports) injury related knee OA. This review details the biological and clinical data indicating the efficacy of interventions targeting neuromuscular and biomechanical factors that make this subset of OA an attractive public health target, and highlights research opportunities for the future.

TI  - Lower extremity kinematic analysis in male athletes with unilateral anterior cruciate reconstruction in a jump-landing task and its association with return to sport criteria.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Return to sport (RTS) criteria are widely being used to identify anterior cruciate ligament reconstructed (ACLR) athletes ready to return to sportive activity and reduce risk of ACL re-injury. However, studies show a high rate of ACL re-injury in athletes who passed RTS criteria. This indicates that the current RTS criteria might not be sufficient to determine return to sport time in ACLR athletes. Previous studies have reported a close association between altered lower limb kinematics and ACL re-injury. However, it is not clear how lower extremity kinematics differs between ACLR athletes who passed the RTS-criteria and who failed. This study compared lower extremity kinematics in a jump-landing task between ACLR athletes who passed the RTS criteria (Limb symmetry in hop tests, quadriceps strength and questionnaires) to those who failed and to the healthy individuals. Participants were 27 male football players with unilateral ACLR including 14 who passed -RTS criteria and 13 failed, and 15 healthy football players. A 3D motion capture system recorded participants’ lower extremity motion while performing 10 trials of a bilateral jump-landing task. Hip, knee and ankle angular motion were examined at initial contact. Two-way mixed analysis of variances (2 limbs × 3 groups) and Bonferroni post-hoc tests were performed to compare the joint angles between the limbs and groups. lower hip abduction angle was found in the failed (involved limb 4.1 ° ± 4.2) and passed RTS (involved limb 6.8° ± 3.3) groups compared to the healthy group (non-dominant limb 10.7° ± 3.7). Ankle inversion in the failed RTS (0.4° ± 4.9) group was significantly lower than both passed RTS (4.8° ± 4.8, p = 0.05) and healthy (8.2° ± 8.1, p < 0.001) groups. There were no significant differences between the groups in knee kinematics. Our findings indicate reduced hip abduction during initial contact phase of landing in athletes returned to sport. Reduced hip abduction during the complex multiplanar movement of jump-landing is a risk factor for ACL re-injury. Current RTS criteria may not be sufficient to identify ACLR athletes at high risk of re-injury. The kinematic analysis in conjunction with current RTS criteria can provide additional insight into the return to sport decision making.

TI  - Review of evolution of tunnel position in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
PY  - 2015
AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is one of the commonest knee sport injuries. The annual incidence of the ACL injury is between 100000-200000 in the United States. Worldwide around 400000 ACL reconstructions are performed in a year. The goal of ACL reconstruction is to restore the normal knee anatomy and kinesiology. The tibial and femoral tunnel placements are of primordial importance in achieving this outcome. Other factors that influence successful reconstruction are types of grafts, surgical techniques and rehabilitation programmes. A comprehensive understanding of ACL anatomy has led to the development of newer techniques supplemented by more robust biological and mechanical concepts. In this review we are mainly focussing on the evolution of tunnel placement in ACL reconstruction, focusing on three main categories, i.e., anatomical, biological and clinical outcomes. The importance of tunnel placement in the success of ACL reconstruction is well researched. Definite clinical and functional data is lacking to establish the superiority of the single or double bundle reconstruction technique. While there is a trend towards the use of anteromedial portals for femoral tunnel placement, their clinical superiority over trans-tibial tunnels is yet to be established.

TI  - Impact of Hamstring Graft Diameter on Tendon Strength: A Biomechanical Study
PY  - 2015
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to compare the tensile strength of hamstring grafts of varying combined pull-through diameters within the clinically relevant range of 6 to 9 mm. Methods We tested 44 non-irradiated allograft hamstring grafts (11 per group). Combined looped semitendinosus and gracilis grafts were allocated to the 6-, 7-, 8-, or 9-mm group based on the smallest-diameter lumen that the graft could be “pulled through” using a surgical sizing instrument. Testing was performed on an Instron materials testing machine (Instron, Norwood, MA). Samples were secured with cryoclamps, prestressed, and pulled to failure at a rate of 10% gauge length per second. Results The mean load to failure was 2,359 ± 474 N, 3,263 ± 677 N, 3,908 ± 556 N, and 4,360 ± 606 N for the 6-, 7-, 8-, and 9-mm grafts, respectively. Minimum failure loads were as low as 1,567 N, 2,288 N, 2,874 N, and 3,720 N for each group, respectively. There were statistically significant differences between the 6- and 7-mm, 6- and 8-mm, 6- and 9-mm, and 7- and 9-mm groups ( P  = .01). Conclusions Statistically different increasing tensile strength was seen as graft diameter increased. Significant variability exists in the strength of multi-stranded hamstring allografts within the diameter range of 6 to 9 mm that often falls well below the commonly accepted value of 4,000 N for a hamstring graft. Clinical Relevance Recent evidence suggests a higher early failure rate of hamstring autografts in subsets of patients with graft diameters of 8 mm or less. This study may increase awareness that hamstring grafts may not be nearly as strong as previously appreciated and that increasing tendon diameters by 1 to 2 mm may dramatically affect graft strength. These data may be helpful in preoperative discussions regarding variable hamstring size, strength, and potential intraoperative augmentation options.

TI  - ACL Rehabilitation Progression: Where Are We Now?
PY  - 2017
AB  - With the increase of publications available to the rehabilitation specialist, there is a need to identify a progression to safely progress the patient through their post-operative ACL reconstruction rehabilitation program. Rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction should follow an evidence-based functional progression with graded increase in difficulty in activities. Clinicians should be discouraged not to use strict time frames and protocols when treating patients following ACL reconstruction. Rather, guidelines should be followed that allow the rehabilitation specialists to progress the patient as improvements in strength, edema, proprioception, pain, and range of motion are demonstrated. Prior to returning to sport, specific objective quantitative and qualitative criteria should be met. The time from surgery should not be the only consideration. The rehabilitation specialist needs to take into account tissue healing, any concomitant procedures, patellofemoral joint forces, and the goals of the patient in crafting a structured rehabilitation program. Achieving symmetrical full knee extension, decreasing knee joint effusion, and quadriceps activation early in the rehabilitation process set the stage for a safe progression. Weight bearing is begun immediately following surgery to promote knee extension and hinder quadriceps inhibition. As the patient progresses through their rehabilitative course, the rehabilitation specialist should continually challenge the patient as is appropriate based upon their goals, their levels of strength, amount of healing, and the performance of the given task.

TI  - Technique for All-Inside Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Quadrupled Semitendinosus and Gracilis Autograft.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are common to athletes and non-athletes alike. Whereas the literature has historically supported bone-patellar tendon-bone as the gold standard for active patients who elect to undergo ACL reconstruction, other studies have suggested that soft-tissue grafts do not increase the risk of rerupture. Because graft diameter has a direct effect on revision rates, we share a technique for all-inside ACL reconstruction using quadrupled semitendinosus and gracilis autograft that allows for a predictable, robust graft. Reproducible steps of graft harvesting, tunnel preparation, graft passage, and fixation are shared to achieve a robust anatomic reconstruction.

TI  - Failure load of patellar tendon grafts at the femoral side: 10- versus 20-mm-bone blocks
PY  - 2008
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate whether use of short bone blocks is safe in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Our hypothesis was that the smaller 10-mm-length bone blocks will fail at lower loads than 20-mm-bone blocks. Ten paired human cadaver knees were randomly assigned to the 10- or 20-mm group (group 1 and 2) and underwent bone-patellar tendon-bone femoral fixation with interference screw. Tensile tests were performed using a tensile testing machine (Instron). Stiffness, failure load and failure mode were recorded. Median stiffness was 72 N/mm (16-103) for 10-mm-bone blocks and 91 N/mm (40-130) for 20-mm-bone blocks. Median failure loads were 402 N (87-546) for 10-mm-long bone block and 456 N (163-636) for 20-mm-bone blocks. There was no statistically significant difference between groups (P = 0.35). All bone-patellar tendon-bone grafts were pulled out of the femoral tunnel with interference screw, due to slippage. We concluded that a 10-mm-long bone block was not significantly weaker than a 20-mm-long bone block. Failure loads of a 10-mm-bone block exceeded loading values at passive and active extension of the knee under normal conditions. Ten millimetre bone blocks offered sufficient fixation strength in ACL reconstruction.

TI  - Survivorship and Clinical Results After Hip Arthroscopy: How Should We Define a Good Treatment Option?
PY  - 2016
AB  - While the arthroscopic approach has lower rates of complications with a faster recovery course, technique and pathology-related complications remain. Patient-reported and clinician measured outcome scores use survival of the native hip to quantify hip function and define a successful outcome from a hip procedure. Survivorship is dependent upon the severity and location of hip pathology at initial presentation, and the treatment selected, with the leading causes of persistent pain, dissatisfaction, and reoperation being untreated or inadequately treated pathology. The presence and severity of arthritis is a strong predictor of inferior clinical outcomes, with higher survivorship after arthroscopic treatment in cases with mild or no arthritis compared to moderate or advanced arthritis. Older patients also experience worse outcomes after arthroscopic surgical repair of labral tears and arthroscopic treatment of FAI; however, many authors have attributed this correlation in older patients to the presence of early osteoarthritis in older hips rather than age alone.

TI  - Muscle strength and hop performance criteria prior to return to sports after ACL reconstruction.
PY  - 2011
AB  - The purpose of this article is to present recommendations for new muscle strength and hop performance criteria prior to a return to sports after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. A search was made of relevant literature relating to muscle function, self-reported questionnaires on symptoms, function and knee-related quality of life, as well as the rate of re-injury, the rate of return to sports and the development of osteoarthritis after ACL reconstruction. The literature was reviewed and discussed by the European Board of Sports Rehabilitation in order to reach consensus on criteria for muscle strength and hop performance prior to a return to sports. The majority of athletes that sustain an (ACL) injury do not successfully return to their pre-injury sport, even though most athletes achieve what is considered to be acceptable muscle function. On self-reported questionnaires, the athletes report high ratings for fear of re-injury, low ratings for their knee function during sports and low ratings for their knee-related quality of life. The conclusion is that the muscle function tests that are commonly used are not demanding enough or not sensitive enough to identify differences between injured and non-injured sides. Recommendations for new criteria are given for the sports medicine community to consider, before allowing an athlete to return to sports after an ACL reconstruction. IV.

TI  - Enhancement of tendon-bone healing via the combination of biodegradable collagen-loaded nanofibrous membranes and a three-dimensional printed bone-anchoring bolt.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Abstract A composite biodegradable polymeric model was developed to enhance tendon graft healing. This model included a biodegradable polylactide (PLA) bolt as the bone anchor and a poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanofibrous membrane embedded with collagen as a biomimic patch to promote tendon-bone interface integration. Degradation rate and compressive strength of the PLA bolt were measured after immersion in a buffer solution for 3 months. In vitro biochemical characteristics and the nanofibrous matrix were assessed using a water contact angle analyzer, pH meter, and tetrazolium reduction assay. In vivo efficacies of PLGA/collagen nanofibers and PLA bolts for tendon-bone healing were investigated on a rabbit bone tunnel model with histological and tendon pullout tests. The PLGA/collagen-blended nanofibrous membrane was a hydrophilic, stable, and biocompatible scaffold. The PLA bolt was durable for tendon-bone anchoring. Histology showed adequate biocompatibility of the PLA bolt on a medial cortex with progressive bone ingrowth and without tissue overreaction. PLGA nanofibers within the bone tunnel also decreased the tunnel enlargement phenomenon and enhanced tendon-bone integration. Composite polymers of the PLA bolt and PLGA/collagen nanofibrous membrane can effectively promote outcomes of tendon reconstruction in a rabbit model. The composite biodegradable polymeric system may be useful in humans for tendon reconstruction.

TI  - A novel method for continuous formation of cord-like collagen gels to fabricate durable fibers in which collagen fibrils are longitudinally aligned
PY  - 2018
AB  - We developed a continuous formation method of cord-like collagen gels comprising fibrils preferentially aligned along the geometrical axes (CCGs). Collagen (2.5%) dissolved in a sodium phosphate buffer containing 280 mM of sodium chloride was introduced into a stainless cylinder (length 52 mm, diameter 2.0 mm) warmed at 38°C at a linear velocity of 2.5 mm/s. This process caused collagen fibril alignments under acute fibril formation in the cylinder, resulting in continuous formation of CCGs. Fibril formation rate, shear rate, and shear duration were substantial factors for successful CCG formation. Outstanding advantages of this method over conventional wet spinning include the capacity of this technique to form aligned fibrils in the entire gels and to control the diameter of cord-like gels over 1 mm. The air-drying of CCGs which were crosslinked with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide and N-hydroxy-succinimide produced dry collagen fibers with cross-sectional areas of 0.0123-0.135 mm2 . Upon the rewetting of the fibers, they failed at a stress of 54.5 ± 7.8 MPa, which is higher than the mean failure stress of anterior cruciate ligament tissue (13.3-37.8 MPa). These findings indicate that the CCG formation method enables the fabrication of collagen fibers which are potential components of collagen-based artificial tendons. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

PY  - 2014
AB  - Background:The incidence of second anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in the first 12 months after ACL reconstruction (ACLR) and return to sport (RTS) in a young, active population has been reported to be 15 times greater than that in a previously uninjured cohort. There are no reported estimates of whether this high relative rate of injury continues beyond the first year after RTS and ACLR.Hypothesis:The incidence rate of a subsequent ACL injury in the 2 years after ACLR and RTS would be less than the incidence rate reported within the first 12 months after RTS but greater than the ACL injury incidence rate in an uninjured cohort of young athletes.Study Design:Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.Methods:Seventy-eight patients (mean age, 17.1 ± 3.1 years) who underwent ACLR and were ready to return to a pivoting/cutting sport and 47 controls (mean age, 17.2 ± 2.6 years) who also participated in pivoting/cutting sports were prospectively enrolled.

TI  - Suture Augmented Versus Standard Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Matched Comparative Analysis.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Purpose To compare outcomes between standard anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) using hamstring grafts with and without suture augmentation (SA). Methods Patients who underwent ACLR with hamstring autografts or allografts with minimum 2-year follow-up were retrospectively reviewed. Patients undergoing ACLR with SA were matched 1:1 by age, gender, body mass index, graft type, and revision status to standard ACLR. Range of motion, pain, postoperative activity, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), and complications were collected. Paired 2-tailed Student's t -tests and Pearson's χ 2 -tests were used for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. A multivariate analysis of variance was conducted. Return to preinjury activity level was assessed using Spearman's rho and Pearson's χ 2 -tests. Results Sixty patients at a mean age of 29.50 ± 6.60 years, 43.4% male, body mass index 26.27 ± 3.37, and follow-up of 29.54 ± 5.37 months were included. Preoperative PROMs were not significantly different ( P >. 05). Postoperative range of motion was similar between groups ( P  = .457). Postoperative average daily (0.60 ± 1.25 vs 1.66 ± 1.90) and maximum daily pain (1.57 ± 1.83 vs 3.35 ± 2.28) were significantly lower for SA ( P P P  = .001). SA was significantly correlated with improved time to return to preinjury activity level (9.17 ± 2.06 vs 12.88 ± 3.94 months; P  = .002) and percentage of preinjury activity level (93.33% ± 13.22% vs 83.17% ± 17.69%; P  = .010). There was a trend toward improved rate of return to preinjury activity level for SA (76.7% vs 56.7%; P  = .100). Conclusions Our study demonstrates that SA hamstring ACLRs were associated with improved PROMs, less pain, and a higher percentage of and earlier return to preinjury activity level when compared with standard hamstring ACLRs without evidence of overconstraint. Level of Evidence Level III, retrospective comparative study.

TI  - Anterior Cruciate Ligament
PY  - 2016
AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a very frequently injured ligament in many sports and usually causes long layoff from the athlete activity. Epidemiology, injury mechanisms, clinical and diagnostic examination, and surgical reconstruction in athletes are pointed out. Successful ACL reconstruction requires physical rehabilitation to return to play (RTP) at the same previous level, and it is more dependent upon the rehabilitation program than different surgical techniques, or type of graft, or fixation. In top-level athletes, we employ the accelerated rehabilitation program that emphasizes full-passive knee extension, immediate motion, immediate full weight bearing, and functional exercises. This chapter particularly focuses on different phases of postoperative rehabilitation and our criteria to RTP based on subjective and objective evaluation.

TI  - Retention of Movement Pattern Changes After a Lower Extremity Injury Prevention Program Is Affected by Program Duration
PY  - 2011
AB  - Background: Changes in movement patterns have been repeatedly observed immediately after completing a lower extremity injury prevention program. However, it is not known if movement pattern changes are maintained after discontinuing the training program.Hypothesis: The ability to maintain movement pattern changes after training has ceased may be influenced by the program’s duration. The authors hypothesized that among individuals who completed either a 3-month or 9-month training program and who demonstrated immediate movement pattern changes, only those who completed the 9-month training program would maintain movement pattern changes after a 3-month period of no longer performing the exercises.Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.Methods: A total of 140 youth soccer athletes from 15 separate teams volunteered to participate. Athletes’ movement patterns were assessed using the Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) at pretest, posttest, and 3 months after ceasing the program (retention test). Ei...

TI  - Quadriceps muscle weakness after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a risk factor for knee osteoarthritis?
PY  - 2010
AB  - Objective

To identify risk factors for knee osteoarthritis (OA) 10–15 years after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. We hypothesized that quadriceps muscle weakness after ACL reconstruction would be a risk factor for radiographic and symptomatic radiographic knee OA 10–15 years later.



Methods

Subjects with ACL reconstruction (n = 258) were followed for 10–15 years. Subjects with unilateral injury at the 10–15-year followup were included in the present study. Outcomes included the Cincinnati knee score, knee joint laxity, hop performance, and isokinetic muscle strength tests at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively. At the 10–15-year followup, radiographs were taken and graded according to the Kellgren/Lawrence classification (range 0–4).



Results

Of the 212 subjects (82%) assessed at the 10–15-year followup, 164 subjects had unilateral injury. The mean ± SD age at ACL reconstruction was 27.4 ± 8.5 years. Increased age (odds ratio [OR] 1.06, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.01–1.11) and meniscal injury and/or chondral lesion (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.00–4.20) showed significantly higher odds for radiographic knee OA. Low self-reported knee function 2 years postoperatively (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.92–0.98) and loss of quadriceps strength between the 2-year and the 10–15-year followup (OR 1.00, 95% CI 1.00–1.01) showed significantly higher odds for symptomatic radiographic knee OA. Quadriceps muscle weakness after ACL reconstruction was not significantly associated with knee OA.



Conclusion

This study detected no association between quadriceps weakness after ACL reconstruction and knee OA as measured 10–15 years later.

TI  - Functional Performance Testing and Patient Reported Outcomes following ACL Reconstruction: A Systematic Scoping Review.
PY  - 2014
AB  - Objective. A systematic scoping review of the literature to identify functional performance tests and patient reported outcomes for patients who undergo anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and rehabilitation that are used in clinical practice and research during the last decade. Methods. A literature search was conducted. Electronic databases used included Medline, PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, PEDro, and AMED. The inclusion criteria were English language, publication between April 2004 and April 2014, and primary ACL reconstruction with objective and/or subjective outcomes used. Two authors screened the selected papers for title, abstract, and full-text in accordance with predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The methodological quality of all papers was assessed by a checklist of the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP). Results. A total of 16 papers were included with full-text. Different authors used different study designs for functional performance testing which led to different outcomes that could not be compared. All papers used a measurement for quantity of functional performance except one study which used both quantity and quality outcomes. Several functional performance tests and patient reported outcomes were identified in this review. Conclusion. No extensive research has been carried out over the past 10 years to measure the quality of functional performance testing and control stability of patients following ACL reconstruction. However this study found that the measurement of functional performance following ACL reconstruction consisting of a one-leg hop for a set distance or a combination of different hops using limb symmetry index (LSI) was a main outcome parameter of several studies. A more extensive series of tests is suggested to measure both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of functional performance after the ACL reconstruction. The KOOS and the IKDC questionnaires are both measures that are increasingly being used for ACL reconstruction throughout the last decade.

TI  - Functional Outcome of Arthroscopically Assisted Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction
PY  - 2014
AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear is the most common ligamentous tear of knee joint. The goal of reconstruction of ACL is to restore the stability of knee joint. This study is to evaluate the functional outcome of Arthroscopically assisted ACL reconstruction using Bone patellar tendon bone graft and quadrupled hamstring graft. Our study of 30 cases of arthroscopic ACL reconstruction(21 Bone patellar tendon bone graft, 9 Quadrupled Hamstrig Graft). We have evaluated th knee function pre and post operatively using international knee documentation committee(IKDC) and Lysholm score. Our study showed that Arthroscopically assisted ACL reconstruction could effectively improve stability and function of knee joint. Our results were almost similar to the results obtained in the standard published literature.

TI  - Regeneration of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament Using Resorbable Metallic and Extracellular Matrix Bioscaffolds
PY  - 2015
AB  - The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is the most frequently injured knee ligament. Because of its low healing capacity, the current standard of treatment is surgical ACL reconstruction. However, follow-up studies 10 years or more after surgery have shown that patients frequently experience long-term complications, including the early development of osteoarthritis. For this reason, scientists and clinicians have explored alternative treatment methods. With the advent of functional tissue engineering, there has been renewed interest in regenerating an injured ACL using biological augmentation. Still, due to the slow process of ACL healing, mechanical augmentation is also needed to restore stability to the knee immediately after surgery, as well as to load the ACL throughout the healing process.
 The purpose of this dissertation was to develop and test a bioresorbable magnesium (Mg) device for mechanical augmentation of a transected ACL in a goat model. First, a ring-shaped device was designed based on the geometry of the goat ACL, and evaluated using a parametric finite element analysis. Then, a robotic/universal force-moment sensor testing system was used to measure the joint stability and in-situ forces in the ACL after repair of the ACL in cadaveric goat stifle joints using the Mg ring (“Mg ring repair”). Under externally applied loads simulating those used in clinical examinations, Mg ring repair could restore joint stability and in-situ forces in the ACL close to normal levels. With these positive findings, in vitro cytocompatility testing was performed by culturing goat ACL fibroblasts with Mg degradation products. Results on cell proliferation and collagen production suggested that the presence of Mg neither impeded nor enhanced the healing process. Finally, the Mg ring was used to repair a surgically transected ACL in skeletally mature goats alongside biological augmentation using an extracellular matrix (ECM) sheet and hydrogel. In this in vivo study, by 6 weeks post-operatively, neo-tissue had begun to fill in the gap between the transected ends of the ACL. By 12 weeks, the ACL was found to have healed and the continuous neo-tissue was composed of aligned collagen fibers, but without hypertrophy. Biomechanically, the structural properties of the healing femur-ACL-tibia complex were improved compared to ECM treatment alone. With the results from this dissertation, the advantages of using combined biological and mechanical augmentation to improve healing of a transected ACL have been demonstrated. Building off these findings, future studies can be performed to further enhance ACL healing, as well as extend the application to the healing of other injured ligaments and tendons. It is our hope that in the future, such an approach could be used clinically to improve short and long-term patient outcomes after orthopaedic surgery.

TI  - Correlation between femoral tunnel length and tunnel position in ACL reconstruction.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Background: The position of the femoral tunnel affects the osseous geometry available for drilling during anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. The length of the tunnel changes with changes in the tunnel position and may have implications for femoral fixation.

Methods: Forty-seven patients with a single-bundle ACL reconstruction underwent computed tomography (CT) evaluation to generate three-dimensional (3D) CT bone models. With use of a previously described anatomic coordinate system, the center of the femoral tunnel was quantified in the posterior-anterior and proximal-distal dimensions on 3D CT. Tunnel length was defined as the distance between the centers of the intra-articular and extra-articular tunnel apertures. The reconstructed knees were dichotomized by anatomy and technique into anatomic (n = 20) and nonanatomic (n = 27) groups as well as according to whether they had undergone medial portal drilling (n = 20) or transtibial drilling (n = 27) for analysis. In addition, a review of the literature on the relationship between tunnel length and tendon-to-bone healing was performed.

Results: Femoral tunnels drilled with nonanatomic footprints were longer (mean [and standard deviation], 43.6 ± 8.5 mm; range, 28.2 to 60.7 mm) than tunnels drilled with anatomic footprints (31.0 ± 6.3 mm; 21.2 to 42.5 mm) (p < 0.001). Tunnels drilled transtibially (44.4 ± 7.6 mm; 32.5 to 60.7 mm) were significantly longer than tunnels drilled through the medial portal (29.8 ± 5.0 mm; 21.2 to 40.3 mm) (p < 0.001). There was a strong correlation between tunnel length and posterior-anterior femoral tunnel position (r = 0.78, p < 0.05), with more anterior tunnel positioning associated with greater tunnel length. There was no correlation between posterior-distal femoral tunnel position and tunnel length (r = −0.05; p = 0.74). There was no consensus in the literature regarding adequate tunnel length for biologic fixation.

Conclusions: Femoral tunnels drilled with anatomic footprints had sufficient length for adequate femoral fixation. Femoral tunnels positioned anterior to the native insertion of the ACL were longer than those in anatomic position.

Clinical Relevance: The results of this study can help the surgeon to consider the relationship between tunnel position and subsequent tunnel length in ACL reconstruction.

TI  - A Comparison of Quadriceps Tendon Autograft With Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Autograft and Hamstring Tendon Autograft for Primary Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Systematic Review and Quantitative Synthesis.
PY  - 2021
AB  - OBJECTIVE There is growing enthusiasm for the increased use of quadriceps tendon (QT) autograft for primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). The purpose of this analysis was to synthesize and quantitatively assess the available evidence comparing QT autograft with hamstring tendon (HT) and bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autografts, regarding functional outcomes, knee stability, anterior knee pain, and revision rates. DATA SOURCES A search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for eligible studies up to May 2018 was conducted. Two reviewers selected studies based on inclusion criteria and assessed methodological quality. Outcomes analyzed were anterior knee pain, graft failure rates, knee stability, functional outcomes, and adverse events. Pooled analyses were performed for continuous and dichotomous variables where appropriate. MAIN RESULTS Ten studies (1 randomized trial and 9 nonrandomized cohorts) met our inclusion criteria, which included 1398 patients. The analysis showed no statistical difference in anterior knee pain when comparing QT and HT autografts, but a significant difference between QT and BPTB autografts [odds ratio, 0.15 (95% confidence interval, 0.08-0.27); P < 0.001]. There were no differences between all 3 autografts in revision rates, knee stability, and patient-reported functional outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Quadriceps tendon autograft is a suitable graft alternative for primary ACLR, as it achieves good clinical outcomes with a low incidence of anterior knee pain. Given the limited quality of the included studies, there is a need for a well-designed multicenter randomized control trial comparing QT autograft with other primary ACL autografts to confirm our findings. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level IV systematic review.

TI  - Anatomic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction utilizing the double-bundle technique.
PY  - 2012
AB  - The goal of every orthopaedic surgeon should be to restore anatomy as close as possible to normal. Intense research on reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and an advancing knowledge of the anatomy and function of the 2 primary bundles of the ACL have led to techniques of ACL reconstruction that more closely restore normal anatomy. Restoring the ACL footprint is one of the most important goals of the surgery, and the choice between anatomic single-bundle and double-bundle ACL reconstruction is determined by the anatomical features of each patient. After reconstruction, the graft undergoes a complex, lengthy process of remodeling; therefore, inappropriate (early), aggressive rehabilitation can lead to graft failure and compromise the patient's outcome. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the anatomy and function of the ACL, the methods for anatomic single-bundle and double-bundle ACL reconstruction, and our recommendations for postoperative rehabilitation.

TI  - Risk of Revision and Reoperation After Quadriceps Tendon Autograft ACL Reconstruction Compared With Patellar Tendon and Hamstring Autografts in a US Cohort of 21,973 Patients.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The use of quadriceps tendon (QT) autografts has increased in the past 10 years. However, there remains a dearth of large studies examining the effects of graft selection on anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) that includes QT grafts.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">To evaluate the risk of subsequent surgical outcomes, including revision and reoperation, for a large cohort of patients with primary ACLR according to autograft selection.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Data from a US health care system ACLR registry were used to conduct a cohort study. Primary isolated autograft ACLRs were identified (2012-2021). The exposure of interest was autograft type: QT, bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB), and hamstring tendon (HT). Multivariable Cox regression models were used to evaluate the risk of aseptic revision (defined as a subsequent surgery where removal and replacement of the original graft for noninfectious reasons was required) and risk of aseptic reoperation (defined as any subsequent surgery for noninfectious reasons where the graft was left intact) according to autograft selection.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The study sample comprised 21,973 ACLRs performed by 290 surgeons at 53 hospitals. QT, BPTB, and HT autografts were used in 1103 (5.0%), 9519 (43.3%), and 11,351 (51.7%) ACLRs, respectively. In adjusted models, no significant differences were observed in revision risk (hazard ratio [HR], 1.06; 95% CI, 0.60-1.89; <i>P</i> = .837) or reoperation risk (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.70-1.43; <i>P</i> = .993) within 4 years of follow-up when comparing QT ACLR with BPTB ACLR. Additionally, no differences in 4-year revision (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.34-1.12; <i>P</i> = .111) or reoperation (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.85-1.80; <i>P</i> = .262) risks were observed when comparing QT ACLR with HT ACLR. HT ACLRs were noted to have a higher risk of revision (HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.25-1.84; <i>P</i> &lt; .001) compared with BPTB ACLRs but a lower risk of reoperation (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75-0.98; <i>P</i> = .024).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">In this large multicenter study using data from an ACLR registry, the authors found no difference in the risk of revision or reoperation when QT was compared with BPTB or HT autograft with the numbers available, but they did find a 1.5 times higher risk of revision when HT autograft was compared with BPTB autograft. Surgeons may use this information when choosing the appropriate graft for ACLR in their patients.</AbstractText>

TI  - Factors affecting patients' graft choice in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2010
AB  - Background: Multiple studies have reported that allografts are acceptable alternatives to autografts for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions. Our clinical practice allows patient involvement in graft decision-making. This study examined the patients’ preference for graft selection and the factors affecting their decision. Methods: Patients scheduled to undergo an ACL reconstruction surgery (n = 129) at a university medical center in Korea were enrolled in this study. Information leaflets with graft descriptions were provided prior to hospital admission, and the patients were allowed to choose one of two surgical graft types. The patients were asked to complete a questionnaire that reflected their decision-making processes, and the patients’ trends and factors affecting their choice of graft were analyzed based on their responses. Results: Most patients (54.3%) selected autografts for the ACL reconstruction. The surgeon’s explanation was the most important factor affecting the final patient decision followed by the information derived from Internet searches. Patients who derived the majority of their understanding of the graft types from the Internet chose allografts at significantly higher rates. Conclusions: Patient graft selection is a reasonable way of designating the type of surgical procedure. Most patients selected autografts for their ACL reconstruction. However, patients who performed significant Internet-based research tended to prefer

TI  - An Automatic Three-Dimensional Evaluation of Screw Placement After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using MDCT Images
PY  - 2013
AB  - <jats:p>A metallic interference screw, which is a fixation device used in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, is important for fixing the grafts to the tibia. Loosening of fixation sometimes happens because the screw is displaced time passes, which results in instability of the knee. It is therefore important to analyze screw displacement highly accurately. The purpose of this study is to propose an evaluation of screw displacement in MDCT imaging of the knee after ACL reconstruction. Clinical experiments used 22 MDCT images that are not displaced in the clinical sense. Results of simulation experiments show that error was 0.14 mm, which was less thanMDCT image resolution. This study concluded that the proposed method useful in evaluating two MDCT images at different time points.</jats:p>

TI  - The Effect of Open- Versus Closed-Kinetic-Chain Exercises on Anterior Tibial Laxity, Strength, and Function Following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Background There is controversy surrounding the early use of open-kinetic-chain (OKC) quadriceps-strengthening exercises following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) due to the belief that increased strain on the graft could cause damage. Objectives To determine whether OKC quadriceps exercises result in differences in anterior tibial laxity, strength, function, quality of life, or adverse events in the ACLR population, when compared to closed-kinetic-chain (CKC) quadriceps exercises. Methods Seven electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, PEDro, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) were searched through April 2017. A systematic review with meta-analysis was conducted on randomized controlled trials comparing OKC versus CKC exercises following ACLR. Outcomes of interest were tibial laxity, strength, and function. A methodological quality assessment of the included studies was completed, and the results were synthesized using meta-analysis and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results Ten studies were included in the review. The meta-analysis demonstrated low- to moderate-quality evidence of no between-group differences in anterior tibial laxity, strength, or patient-reported function at any time point. Meta-analysis was unable to be performed for functional outcomes. Conclusion There was limited to moderate-quality evidence of no difference in anterior tibial laxity, strength, patient-reported function, or physical function with early or late introduction of OKC exercises in the ACLR population, when compared to CKC exercises, at all follow-up time points.

TI  - Human movement variability, nonlinear dynamics, and pathology: Is there a connection?
PY  - 2011
AB  - Fields studying movement generation, including robotics, psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience utilize concepts and tools related to the pervasiveness of variability in biological systems. The concept of variability and the measures for nonlinear dynamics used to evaluate this concept open new vistas for research in movement dysfunction of many types. This review describes innovations in the exploration of variability and their potential importance in understanding human movement. Far from being a source of error, evidence supports the presence of an optimal state of variability for healthy and functional movement. This variability has a particular organization and is characterized by a chaotic structure. Deviations from this state can lead to biological systems that are either overly rigid and robotic or noisy and unstable. Both situations result in systems that are less adaptable to perturbations, such as those associated with unhealthy pathological states or absence of skillfulness.

Often, return-to-sport (RTS) tests of strength and functional hopping rely on limb symmetry indices (LSIs) to identify deficits, although the utility of these measures in athletes with bilateral ACL injuries is unknown.Purpose/Hypothesis:The aim of this study was to investigate if LSIs used as RTS criteria in female patients after unilateral ACLR were appropriate for female patients with bilateral ACL involvement. The hypothesis tested was that asymmetries with traditional LSI measures would be present in a population after unilateral ACLR but would not be present in a population with bilateral ACLR due to the lack of a healthy internal control limb.Study Design:Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.Methods:A total of 45 female subjects were classified into 3 groups: after second (contralateral) ACLR (ACLR-B; n = 15); after primary unilateral ACLR (ACLR-U; n = 15); and uninjured...

TI  - Correlation of graft position, knee laxity and clinical outcome: comparison with native anterior cruciate ligament using magnetic resonance imaging study.
PY  - 2009
AB  - OBJECTIVE To compare the sagittal obliquity of anterior cruciate ligament graft with normal native anterior cruciate ligament in contralateral knee, to determine the effect of sagittal obliquity and axial femoral tunnel graft placement on stability and functional knee score (Lysholm), and to measure size of graft after complete ligamentization. MATERIAL AND METHOD Seventy single tunnel quadruple hamstring anterior cruciate reconstructed knee in unilateral ACL injury patients were evaluated at 18 months after surgery. At follow up, patients were evaluated including measurement of knee laxity by using side to side different on KT 1000 arthromeres and clinical outcome by completed Lysholm functional knee questionnaires. Sagittal T1 weighted magnetic resonance image with complete dimension of graft from origin to insertion on each side of knee were depicted to compare the obliquity by measuring the intersection angle of the graft line with the tibial plateau plane. The axial femoral tunnel was determined by angle between anteroposterior axis of distal femur and long axis of femoral tunnel. The diameter of graft was also measured. RESULTS Graft obliquity was average 58 degrees with range between 41 degrees and 69 degrees. In contralateral native ACL obliquity was average 50 degrees with range between 33 degrees and 63 degrees. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Average axial femoral tunnel was 36 degrees with range between 10 degrees and 56 degrees. Knee laxity (KT-1 000 arthrometer; average pre-op = 6, post-op = 3) and Lysholm knee scores (average score; pre-op 55, post-op score 89) were significantly improved after surgery (p < 0.01). There was no correlation between degree of sagittal obliquity and axial femoral tunnel with knee laxity and functional score in this series. Graft size was increased in average 8% after 18 months post-operatively. CONCLUSION ACL grafts in patients with appropriate tibial tunnel placement were more vertical than native ACL. There was no significant effect of degree of sagittal obliquity and axial femoral tunnel to antero-postero stability and knee score. ACL graft size was increased in diameter during post-operative period. Graft-notch distance should be considered during operation.

TI  - Two-Plane Assessment of Knee Muscles Isometric and Isokinetic Torques After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.
PY  - 2018
AB  - BACKGROUND We tested the hypothesis that, in patients participating in 17 weeks of postoperative physiotherapy after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), maximal isometric torque (IT) and peak torque (PT) generated by the muscles affecting the operated knee joint in the sagittal and transverse planes are not restored. We also present the application of IT and PT measurements of the muscles affecting the knee joint in 2 planes of motion. MATERIAL AND METHODS IT and PT of the knee extensor and flexor muscles and the muscles internally rotating the shin were measured in 30 males who participated in postoperative physiotherapy for 17 weeks after ACLR (ACLR group) and 30 males with no injuries (control group). RESULTS Significantly lower IT and PT values were noted in the operated knee extensors and flexors. The differences were also noted in the PT for the muscles internally rotating the shin and in the IT of those muscles in the position of 25° of internal rotation. Significantly lower relative IT and PT values were noted for studied muscle groups in comparison to the control group. CONCLUSIONS Seventeen weeks of postoperative physiotherapy after ACLR did not result in complete restoration of IT and PT of the muscles affecting the operated knee joint, suggesting that even after 17 weeks of physiotherapy following ACLR, athletes may not be ready to return to sports. The results demonstrate the usefulness of biplanar analysis of muscle strength under isometric and isokinetic conditions in the monitoring and assessment of physiotherapeutic procedures.

TI  - A LbL-Assembled Bioactive Coating Modified Nanofibrous Membrane for Rapid Tendon-Bone Healing in ACL Reconstruction.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Introduction In anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, hamstring tendon autograft is a well-accepted surgical choice as an alternative ACL graft. But the main disadvantage of autograft is its inefficient healing with host bone-tunnel which will leading to surgery failure. Methods A biomimetic nanofibrous membrane for tendon-bone integration is fabricated in this work, which is composed of polycaprolactone (PCL) electrospinning membrane and chitosan/hyaluronic acid (CS/HA) multilayers film. Results By using layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly this functional CS/HA multilayer films are deposited on the surface of PCL nanofiber to enable the local delivery of stromal cell-derived factor-1 α (SDF-1α) and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) in tendon-bone interface. This membrane can promote cell proliferation and recruitment, as well as inducing the osteogenic differentiation and recruitment of BMSCs. Conclusion Further in vivo studies demonstrate that to wrap the tendon autograft using the membrane may afford superior tendon-bone integration and inhibit scar tissue formation in a rabbit ACL reconstruction model. More importantly, the biomechanical properties of the tendon-bone interface have been improved. This study shows that this biomimetic nanofibrous membrane is effective for improving tendon-bone healing after ACL reconstruction surgery.

TI  - Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with a Single-Bundle Autologous Quadriceps Tendon
PY  - 2016
AB  - The quadriceps tendon is a suitable graft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Although the quadriceps tendon is the least used autograft for ACL reconstruction, its versatility, especially in graft sizing, and its biomechanical and histological properties allow for proper individualized treatments. Clinical outcomes are also good, with the advantages of increased primary bone-to-bone fixation strength associated to less tunnel widening and less postoperative laxity as found in BPTB, but without the disadvantage of increased incidence of anterior knee pain. Complication rate is low, with minimal risk of patellar fracture reported in literature. Given these findings, the quadriceps tendon autograft can be considered as one of the autograft of choice for primary ACL reconstruction in patients with high functional demands.

TI  - Location of the tibial tunnel aperture affects extrusion of the lateral meniscus following reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament.
PY  - 2017
AB  - The anterior root of the lateral meniscus provides functional stability to the meniscus. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between the position of the tibial tunnel and extrusion of the lateral meniscus after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, where extrusion provides a proxy measure of injury to the anterior root. The relationship between extrusion and tibial tunnel location was retrospectively evaluated from computed tomography and magnetic resonance images of 26 reconstructed knees, contributed by 25 patients aged 17-31 years. A measurement grid was used to localize the position of the tibial tunnel based on anatomical landmarks identified from the three-dimensional reconstruction of axial computed tomography images of the tibial plateaus. The reference point-to-tibial tunnel distance (mm) was defined as the distance from the midpoint of the lateral edge of the grid to the posterolateral aspect of the tunnel aperture. The optimal cutoff of this distance to minimize post-operative extrusion was identified using receiver operating curve analysis. Extrusion of the lateral meniscus was positively correlated to the reference point-to-tibial tunnel distance (r 2  = 0.64; p  5 mm was 0.40 ± 0.43 mm, compared to 1.40 ± 0.51 mm for a distance ≤5 mm (p < 0.001). Therefore, a posterolateral location of the tibial tunnel aperture within the footprint of the anterior cruciate ligament decreases the reference point-to-tibial tunnel distance and increases extrusion of the lateral meniscus post-reconstruction. © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

TI  - Similar risk of ACL graft revision for alpine skiers, football and handball players: the graft revision rate is influenced by age and graft choice
PY  - 2019
AB  - Objectives The risk of graft revision following ACL reconstruction may depend on the sport type the individuals are engaged in. The purpose of this study was to report the ACL graft revision rate in alpine skiers, football and handball players. Materials and methods Primary ACL reconstructions and graft revision data from 2004 to December 2016 were obtained from the Norwegian Cruciate Ligament Registry. The graft survival rates were calculated for individuals in each of the three sport types, for bone patellar tendon bone (BPTB) and hamstring tendons (HT) grafts separately, and related to age at primary operation and sex. Results A total of 711 grafts in 14 201 primary ACL reconstructions were revised (5.0%) after median 6 years, 3.8% in alpine skiers, 5.0% in soccer and 6.1% in handball players (p Conclusion The revision rate for ACL grafts was similar among alpine skiers, football and handball players, and the results support the use of BPTB grafts in young athletes with closed growth zones in the knee.

TI  - Neuromuscular changes after aerobic exercise in people with anterior cruciate ligament-reconstructed knees.
PY  - 2011
AB  - Context: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions are common, especially in young, active people. The lower extremity neuromuscular adaptations seen after aerobic exercise provide information about how previously injured patients perform and highlight deficits and, hence, areas for focused treatment. Little information is available about neuromuscular performance after aerobic exercise in people with ACL reconstructions. Objective: To compare dynamic balance, gluteus medius muscle activation, vertical jump height, and hip muscle strength after aerobic exercise in people with ACL-reconstructed knees. Design: Case-control study. Setting: Research laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: Of 34 recreationally active volunteers, 17 had a unilateral primary ACL reconstruction at least 2 years earlier and 17 were matched controls. Intervention(s): All participants performed 20 minutes of aerobic exercise on a treadmill. Main Outcome Measure(s): We recorded dynamic, single-legged balance electromyograp...

TI  - The Effectiveness of Strengthening of Hip Extensors and Ankle Plantar Flexors in Early Post-Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction
PY  - 2018
AB  - AbstractBackground: Impaired hip strength may underlie abnormal movement patterns, suggesting that diminished hip strength may increase the risk of ACL injury and re injury after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.Aim of Study: To investigate the effect of strengthening of hip extensors and ankle plantar flexors in early Anterior Cruciate Ligament reconstruction on knee effusion, knee function, hip, knee and ankle muscles strength.Methods: The study was conducted on 30 male patients referred from the orthopedic surgeon with early post operative Anteior Cruciate Ligament reconstruction by hamstring graft or patellar tendon graft after acute injuries, their age range from 18-40 years and were randomly assigned into two groups. Group A: Consisted of fifteen patients who had received open kinetic chain strengthening exercises for hip extensors and ankle plantar flexors in addition to the traditional accelerated program. Group B: Consisted of fifteen patients who had received the traditional accelerated program for 6 weeks (three sessions per week), effusion grading scale for effusion to assess effusion, handheld dynamometer to assess muscle power, Westen Ontario and MACmaster universities score and Time Up and Go test for functional assessment.Results: There was no significant difference between both groups for, hip extensors force and (TUG at 3 weeks). There was no significant difference between both groups for knee extensors torque between base line and 3 weeks and the same for plantar flexors force and WOMAC at 3 weeks. There was significant difference between both groups for knee extensors torque between 3 and 6 weeks, WOMAC at 6 weeks, TUG at 6 weeks and plantar flexors force between 3 and 6 weeks.Conclusion: Adding strengthening exercises of hip exten-sors and plantar flexors to the traditional accelerated protocol added more beneficial outcomes in relation to function after 6 weeks.

ACL injuries are common, often devastating injuries that lead to short-term disability and long-term sequelae, many of which lack effective treatment, such as osteoarthritis. Therefore, prevention of ACL injury is currently the only effective intervention for these life-altering sequelae, while much of the literature has a rehabilitative focus.

TI  - A New Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Fixation Technique (Quadrupled Semitendinosus Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction With Polyetheretherketone Cage Fixation)
PY  - 2012
AB  - Fixation of the graft during anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery has been the subject of numerous technical innovations but still remains a challenge. This article describes a novel technique of graft fixation for hamstring tendon reconstruction: the Cage For One system (Sacimex, Aix-en-Provence, France). The technique uses only the semitendinosus tendon, which is looped to create a 4-strand graft. Leaving the gracilis tendon intact probably reduces the loss of knee flexion strength. The graft is indirectly anchored into both tunnels with polyetheretherketone cages by use of polyethylene terephthalate tape strips. Both cages and strips are magnetic resonance imaging compatible and do not create artifacts. The tunnels are drilled by an outside-in method with minimal incisions. This type of fixation creates a 360° bone contact at 1.5 cm in each tunnel and is compatible with double-bundle reconstruction. This easy-to-use novel technique of fixation for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction produces a strong 4-strand graft while harvesting only the semitendinosus tendon and leaving the gracilis tendon intact to reduce flexion strength loss and preserve rotatory stability of the knee. It creates an immediate solid fixation that is independent of graft integration in the early postoperative period, allowing the patient to start immediate rehabilitation without the use of a brace.

PY  - 2014
AB  - Results: Comparison of operative and nonoperative cohorts revealed no significant differences in age, sex, body mass index, or rate of initial meniscal injury (p > 0.05 for all). Operative cohorts had significantly less need for further surgery (12.4% compared with 24.9% for nonoperative, p = 0.0176), less need for subsequent meniscal surgery (13.9% comparedwith29.4%,p=0.0017),andlessdeclineintheTegnerscore(21.9comparedwith 23.1,p=0.0215).Adifference in pivot-shift test results was observed (25.5% pivot-positive compared with 46.6% for nonoperative) but did not reach significance (p = 0.09). No significant differences were seen in outcome scores (Lysholm, International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC], or final Tegner scores) or the rate of radiographically evident degenerative joint disease (p > 0.05 for all). Conclusions: At a mean of 13.9 ± 3.1 years after injury, the patients who underwent ACL reconstruction had fewer subsequent meniscal injuries, less need for further surgery, and significantly greater improvement in activity level as measured with the Tegner score. There were no significant differences in the Lysholm score, IKDC score, or development of radiographically evident osteoarthritis. Level of Evidence: Therapeutic Level III.

TI  - “Anatomic” Single-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Reduces Both Anterior Translation and Internal Rotation During the Pivot Shift
PY  - 2014
AB  - Background:The ability of single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction to restore rotational control has been questioned by proponents of the double-bundle technique. The term anatomic positioning has become popularized in recognition of the incorrect positioning sometimes used in the past, which may have contributed to the lack of rotation control. The pivot-shift test remains the most clinically useful measure of ACL deficiency, and it is now possible to measure it both accurately and objectively using computer navigation.Hypothesis:Single-bundle ACL reconstruction will reduce anterior translation and internal rotation of the tibia during the pivot-shift test when compared with the contralateral uninjured knee.Study Design:Descriptive laboratory study.Methods:A total of 20 patients with an acute isolated ACL rupture underwent reconstruction with a single-bundle autologous hamstring graft. Computer navigation was used intraoperatively to plot the pivot shift before and after reconstructi...

TI  - Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury and Knee Osteoarthritis: An Umbrella Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Objective To conduct a systematic review of reviews to summarize the (1) risk for development and (2) prevalence of knee osteoarthritis (OA) after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and surgical treatment and (3) compare prevalence rates between surgical and nonsurgical treatment of ACL injury. Date sources Five electronic databases were searched using medical subject heading and text words up to February 2020 to identify English language reviews. Study selection Studies were included if they were a systematic review or meta-analysis. Data extraction Thirteen eligible reviews were included, and the main outcome extracted was knee OA prevalence or risk data and any meta-analysis results. Data synthesis Results from reviews were combined with a summary meta-analysis based on odds ratios (ORs) or proportions. There was a near 7-fold and 8-fold increase in the odds for the development of knee OA post ACL injury [OR = 6.81 (5.70-8.13)] and ACL reconstruction [OR = 7.7, (6.05-9.79)]. Data were too heterogenous to specify a point estimate prevalence for OA after ACL injury, but OA prevalence was estimated at 36% (19.70-53.01) at near 10 years after reconstruction surgery. A significantly higher prevalence of OA was found for those who received surgical treatment at a minimum 10-year follow-up [OR = 1.40 (1.17-1.68)]. Conclusions This study combines all data from previous systematic reviews into a single source to show that ACL injury markedly increases the risk for development of knee OA, which is likely to be present in the long term in approximately a third of patients who have reconstruction surgery. Surgical treatment does not reduce OA prevalence in the longer term compared with nonsurgical treatment.

TI  - The relationship between single-limb squat and jump-cut kinematics
PY  - 2019
AB  - No objective criteria exist for progressing athletes into cutting manoeuvres following ACL reconstruction (ACLR). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between a jump-cut task (JC) and the single-limb squat (SLS) in both ACLR and healthy controls. Case-control, laboratory based. Twenty-three participants with a history of ACLR (Age = 21 ± 3 years; Height = 174.5 ± 7.2 cm; Mass = 76.2 ± 9.9 kg) and 23 healthy controls participants (Age = 21 ± 3 years; Height = 173.8 ± 9.2 cm; Mass = 75.0 ± 10.5 kg) were included. Kinematics were collected bilaterally. Correlations between tasks were evaluated for kinematics. Independent sample t-tests were used to evaluate differences between groups for each dependent variable. Peak trunk rotation and medial knee displacement were strongly correlated (p < 0.001, r2 = 0.63), between tasks. ACLR group performed SLS and JC tasks with less sagittal plane motion compared to healthy controls (p < 0.05). Lack of frontal and transverse plane control during SLS resulted in positions of increased lateral trunk flexion, hip adduction, and medial knee displacement during JC. The SLS may be considered for use as a clinical predictor of JC during rehabilitation following ACLR.

TI  - Complications following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in the English NHS
PY  - 2011
AB  - Unlike the English National Joint Registry (NJR) for arthroplasty, no surgeon driven national database currently exists for ligament surgery in England. Therefore information on outcome and adverse events following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) surgery is limited to case series. This restricts the ability to make formal recommendations upon surgical care. Prospectively collected data, which is routinely collected on every NHS patient admitted to hospital in England, was analysed to determine national rates of 90-day symptomatic deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) rate, 30-day wound infection and readmission rates following primary ACL reconstruction between March 2008 and February 2010 (13,941 operations, annual incidence 13.5 per 100,000 English population). 90-day DVT and PTE rates were 0.30% (42) and 0.18% (25) respectively. There were no in-hospital deaths. 0.75% (104) of the consecutive patient cohort had a wound complication recorded. 0.25% (35) underwent a further procedure to wash out the infected knee joint and 1.36% (190) were readmitted to an orthopaedic ward within 30days. This is the first national comprehensive study of the incidence of significant complications following ACL surgery in England. This should allow meaningful interpretation of future baseline data supporting the development of a national ligament registry.

TI  - A security evaluation of the Rigid-fix crosses pin system used for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in tibial fixation site.
PY  - 2014
AB  - Our study aims to evaluate the safeness and feasibility that Rigid-fix cross pin system was used for hamstring graft anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in the tibial fixation site. In this study, eleven adult conservative cadaver knees were performed using the Rigid-fix Cross Pin device in the tibial fixation site for modeling the ACL reconstruction. The guide rod top was put through the tibial tunnel at the three horizontal positions: equal pace to articular facet (group A), the plane 5 mm below articular facet (group B), and the plane 10 mm below articular facet (group C). We gave four rotation positions to the cross-pin guide: 0°, 30°, 45°, 60° slope, referring to the parallel line of the posterior border of tibial plateau. We recorded the iatrogenic damages incidence, in the four different slope angle in the three groups, and then compare the incidence using Chi-Square test. Our results suggested that the incidence of chondral injury of tibial plateau in group B and group C was significantly lower compared to group A (χ (2) A-B = 27.077, χ (2) A-C 45.517, P = 0.000); However, there was no significant difference for the incidence penetrating the medial condyle of tibial plateau among the three groups (χ (2) = 5.733, P = 0.057); The highest incidence of injuring ligamentum transversum is in group A with 72.7%, especially at the 60° slope angle. In summary, our study suggested that in order to achieve the satisfactory clinical effect for the Rigid-fix system used in the tibia end fixation of ACL reconstruction surgery, the guide rod top should be put at the 5 mm below articular facet with a slope that parallel to the tibial medial plane at 30°-60° slope angle.

TI  - Factors Used to Determine Return to Unrestricted Sports Activities After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction
PY  - 2011
AB  - Purpose Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is commonly performed in athletes, with the goal of return to sports activities. Unfortunately, this operation may fail, and the rates of either reinjuring an ACL-reconstructed knee or sustaining an ACL rupture to the contralateral knee range from 3% to 49%. One problem that exists is a lack of information and consensus regarding the appropriate criteria for releasing patients to unrestricted sports activities postoperatively. The purpose of this study was to determine the published criteria used to allow athletes to return to unrestricted sports activities after ACL reconstruction. Methods A systematic search was performed to identify the factors investigators used to determine when return to athletics was allowed after primary ACL reconstruction. Inclusion criteria were English language, publication within the last 10 years, clinical trial, all adult patients, primary ACL reconstruction, original research investigation, and minimum 12 months' follow-up. Results Of 716 studies identified, 264 met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 105 (40%) failed to provide any criteria for return to sports after ACL reconstruction. In 84 studies (32%) the amount of time postoperatively was the only criterion provided. In 40 studies (15%) the amount of time along with subjective criteria were given. Only 35 studies (13%) noted objective criteria required for return to athletics. These criteria included muscle strength or thigh circumference (28 studies), general knee examination (15 studies), single-leg hop tests (10 studies), Lachman rating (1 study), and validated questionnaires (1 study). Conclusions The results of this systematic review show noteworthy problems and a lack of objective assessment before release to unrestricted sports activities. General recommendations are made for quantification of muscle strength, stability, neuromuscular control, and function in patients who desire to return to athletics after ACL reconstruction, with acknowledgment of the need for continued research in this area. Level of Evidence Level IV, systematic review of Level I to IV studies.

TI  - Pre-operative factors predicting good outcome in terms of health-related quality of life after ACL reconstruction
PY  - 2012
AB  - The life situation of many patients changes after an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture and subsequent reconstruction, and this may affect their health-related quality of life in many ways. It is well known that the overall clinical results after ACL reconstruction are considered good, but pre-operative predictive factors for a good post-operative clinical outcome after ACL reconstruction have not been studied in as much detail. The purpose of this study was to identify pre-operative factors that predict a good post-operative outcome as measured by the Short Form 36 (SF-36) and Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) 3-6 years after ACL reconstruction. Seventy-three patients scheduled for ACL reconstruction were clinically examined pre-operatively. The SF-36 and KOOS questionnaires were sent by mail to these patients 3-6 years after reconstruction. Predictive factors for health-related quality of life were investigated using a stepwise regression analysis. In conclusion, pre-operative factors, such as pivot shift, knee function, and range of motion, may predict a good post-operative outcome and explain up to 25% in terms of health-related quality of life after ACL reconstruction. Furthermore, it appears that the patients' pre-injury and pre-operative Tegner activity levels are important predictors of post-operative health-related quality of life.

TI  - Preservation of Remnant Attachment Improves Graft Healing in a Rabbit Model of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction
PY  - 2013
AB  - Purpose To determine the effect of remnant preservation on the healing of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tendon graft after reconstruction in an animal model. Methods Fifty-two New Zealand rabbits were divided into 6 groups. Revascularization and graft healing were studied in groups 1 through 4 (n = 8 each). The biomechanical properties of the graft complex were evaluated in group 5 (n = 12). The blood flow and biomechanical characteristics of the intact ACL were evaluated in group 6 (n = 8). Both knees of each rabbit were subjected to ACL reconstruction with 2-mm grafts of Achilles tendon splits. The right knees were reconstructed with remnant preservation, whereas the remnants in the left knees were debrided. The revascularization and remodeling of grafts were evaluated at 6, 12, 18, and 24 weeks after reconstruction. Tendon-to-bone integration was investigated histomorphologically. The tensile load strengths of graft complexes were also tested. Results The blood flow in the graft was significantly higher in the remnant-preserved group than in the remnant-debrided group ( P P P P P Conclusions The preservation of the remnant attachment in ACL reconstruction improved the revascularization and remodeling of the graft and enhanced the biomechanical properties of the integrated graft. Clinical Relevance Preservation of the remnant attachment may benefit healing of the tendon graft in ACL reconstruction.

TI  - Short-term Follow-up of Double Bundle ACL Reconstruction using Autogenous Hamstring Tendons Fixed with Ligament Plate Ⓡ
PY  - 2009
AB  - Purpose: We wanted to evaluate the clinical outcomes at a minimum 1-year following anatomic double bundle ACL reconstruction with using autogenous hamstring tendons fixed with Ligament Plate Ⓡ . Materials and Methods: We evaluated a total of 50 patients. Semitendinosus tendon was used for the reconstruction of the anteromedial bundle and the gracilis tendon was used for the reconstruction of the posterolateral bundle. For femoral fixation, we used an anteromedial bundle that was suspended in Ligament Plate Ⓡ and a posterolateral bundle linked with Mersilene tape Ⓡ . For tibial fixation, we used double post-tie. The average follow-up period was 16.5 months. We analyzed the clinical and radiographic results. Results: At the last follow-up, the Lysholm score was 92.4±6.8 points. For the IKDC score, there were 35 cases of grade A, 14 cases of grade B and 1 case of grade C. The Lachman test was negative for 40 cases, it was grade 1 for 9 cases and it was grade 2 for 1 case and the pivot shift test was negative for 45 cases and it was grade 1 for 5 cases. The side-to-side differences with the KT-2000 and the anterior drawer radiogram were 1.3±1.6 mm and 1.3±1.3 mm, respectively. The femoral tunnel enlarged to 1.7±0.6 mm in the anteromedial aspect and 1.6±0.7 mm in the posterolateral aspect, and the tibial tunnel enlarged to 1.2±0.4 mm in the anteromedial aspect and 1.4±0.5 mm in the posterolateral aspect. Conclusion: Anatomic ACL reconstruction using autogenous hamstring tendons that are fixed with Ligament Plate Ⓡ showed good clinical results due to the strong strength of early fixation and the anatomic

TI  - The role of ACL injury in the development of posttraumatic knee osteoarthritis.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Acute anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are most frequently sustained by young, physically active individuals. ACL injuries are seen at high incidence in adolescents and young adults performing sports and occupational activities that involve pivoting. Young women participating in pivoting sports have a 3 to 5 times higher risk of ACL injury than men. Studies show that ACL injury increases osteoarthritis (OA) risk with symptomatic OA appearing in roughly half of individuals 10-15 years later. Because the majority of patients sustaining acute ACL tears are younger than 30, this leads to early onset OA with associated pain and disability during premium work and life growth years between ages 30 and 50. Effective strategies to prevent ACL injury and to reduce subsequent OA risk in those sustaining acute ACL tears are needed.

          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A total of 10 fresh-frozen human cadaveric knees (mean age 81 ± 16.3 years) without history of previous ligament injury were used in this study. A layer-by-layer dissection was performed, and measurements were obtained using a tactile 3-dimensional (3-D) measuring arm to define the anatomy of the MPR in relation to surgically relevant landmarks, such as the superficial medial collateral ligament (sMCL) and medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL). The 3-D datasets were used for multiplanar reconstruction.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The tibial and femoral attachment of the MPR were identified in 100% of cases. Layer-by-layer dissection confirmed its close topography to the sMCL. The mean length of the MPR was 84.9 ± 9.1 mm. The average width of the tibial and femoral attachment was 23.8 ± 3.1 mm and 69.2 ± 8.2 mm, respectively. The distance from the midpoint of the MPR tibial attachment to the midpoint of the distal tibial attachment of the sMCL was 27.2 ± 5.8 mm. Femorally, the MPR attached at the anterior border of the MPFL over a mean distance of 52.3 ± 9.4 mm.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Conclusion" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The MPR is a distinct tibiofemoral structure with well-defined tibial and femoral attachments, which could be consistently identified. Layer-by-layer dissection confirmed its close topography to the sMCL and MPFL.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Clinical Relevance" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">As injuries to the anteromedial side of the knee may contribute to anteromedial rotational rotatory instability (AMRI), precise knowledge of the underlying anatomy of the MPR may be necessary to perform an anatomic reconstruction of the anteromedial side of the knee.</AbstractText>

TI  - La rupture du ligament croisé antérieur, de l’analyse préopératoire du type de rupture à l’évaluation finale à deux ans, retentissement selon le transplant choisi sur les résultats subjectifs et objectifs
PY  - 2008
AB  - This study is a synthesis of three series. The first study was prospective on 418 patients with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear (group I). Two population of ACL ruptures were identified. One population with a postero-lateral bundle preserved in 16%, the mean medial anterior tibial translation side to side was 4.97 mm, the Lachman test was delayed in 40% with no or glide pivot shift in 73%. The second population with a complete ACL tear had a mean medial anterior tibial translation side to side of 7.93 mm, the Lachman test was soft in 98% with gross pivot shift in 80%. The second study was a retrospective study on 258 patients (group II) at 26 months follow-up, it correlated the impact of the type of graft on the clinical objective and subjective results. Twenty-eight percent had anterior knee pain, 33% for the patellar tendon and 25% for the hamstrings, the subjective IKDC was significantly lower for the painful knees, and 68% of the patellar tendon had a hypoesthesia and only 32% for the hamstrings. The ability to walk on the knee was 68% for the hamstrings and 35% for the patellar tendon. The third study was retrospective on 127 patients, 24 months after ACL reconstruction (group III), all were tested on a isokinetic machine for the extensor, the flexor and the internal rotator. In the total population, a 10% extensor and flexor deficit and a 5% rotator deficit was noted. A significant difference between patellar tendon and hamstrings in terms of muscular recovery was found. It pointed out that a more specific rehabilitation should be done on the hamstring group. The muscular recovery was correlated to the highest subjective score. This study allowed the surgeon to be more specific in the ACL tear definition, to adapt the graft choice to the type of sport activity but also to the type of work the patient does and finally to modify the rehabilitation protocol for the hamstring technique.

TI  - Autografts commonly used in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2011
AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is among the most common orthopaedic procedures in the United States, with >200,000 performed annually. Much has been published regarding the use of autograft versus allograft. Bone-patellar tendon-bone is the most frequently used autograft, but hamstring and quadriceps tendon grafts are common alternatives. Each graft has distinct advantages and disadvantages, and selection is individualized. Fixation methods vary by graft type. Fixation resulting in a construct that is too rigid may restrict knee range of motion. Donor site morbidity must be considered, as well. Autograft harvest may result in anterior knee pain, kneeling pain, anterior knee numbness, muscle weakness, and patellar fracture. Appropriate graft selection is essential to optimize outcomes.

TI  - Factors Involved in the Development of Osteoarthritis After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Surgery
PY  - 2010
AB  - Background: The incidence of osteoarthritis after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is disturbingly high, with reports of nearly 50% of patients developing mild to moderate osteoarthritis 6 years after surgery. Few studies have assessed the factors involved in the development of osteoarthritis.Hypothesis: The following 10 factors will be found to be predictive of osteoarthritis: meniscectomy, chondral damage, patellar tendon grafting, age at surgery, time delay between injury and surgery, type and intensity of postsurgery sport, quadriceps strength, hamstring strength, quadriceps-to-hamstring strength ratio, and residual joint laxity.Study Design: Cohort study (prognosis); Level of evidence, 1.Methods: Fifty-six subjects with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction were followed for 6 years after surgery. Assessment included KT-1000 arthrometer testing, isokinetic strength testing, a return-to-sport questionnaire, and a radiograph assessment. A discriminant analysis was performed to assess which...

TI  - Is patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis an under-recognised outcome of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction? A narrative literature review
PY  - 2012
AB  - Patellofemoral joint (PFJ) osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent disease capable of being a potent source of knee symptoms. Although anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and reconstruction (ACLR) are well-established risk factors for the development of tibiofemoral joint OA, PFJ OA after ACL reconstruction has gone largely unrecognised. This is despite the high prevalence of anterior knee pain after ACLR, which can reduce the capacity for physical activity and quality of life. The susceptibility of the PFJ to degenerative change after ACLR may have implications for current rehabilitation strategies. This review summarises the evidence describing the prevalence of PFJ OA after ACLR and examines why this compartment may be at increased risk of early onset OA after ACLR. Strategies that address the modifiable factors for risk of PFJ OA may aid in alleviating joint loads and symptoms for people after ACLR.

TI  - All-epiphyseal, all-inside anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction technique for skeletally immature patients.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are an increasingly recognized problem in the juvenile population. Unfortunately, outcomes with conservative treatment are extremely poor. Adult reconstruction techniques are inappropriate to treat skeletally immature patients because of the risk of physeal complications, including limb-length discrepancy and angular deformities. “Physeal-sparing” reconstruction techniques exist, but their ability to restore knee stability is not well understood. We describe an all-epiphyseal ACL reconstruction for use in skeletally immature patients. This is an all-inside technique with the femoral tunnel drilled retrograde and the tibial tunnel drilled retrograde; both tunnels are entirely within the epiphysis. Fixation of the hamstring autograft is achieved with soft-tissue buttons on both the femur and tibia. We present case examples for 2 patients who underwent the all-inside, all-epiphyseal reconstruction and our postoperative rehabilitation protocol. We present a novel surgical technique for an all-inside, all-epiphyseal ACL reconstruction in skeletally immature patients.

TI  - Saphenous nerve injury during harvesting of one or two hamstring tendons for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2015
AB  - Abstract Objective The aim of this study was to assess whether harvesting of two hamstring tendons (semitendinosus and gracilis) has the same rate of nerve injury as harvesting of the semitendinosus tendon alone, used as a triple graft. Methods Changes in sensitivity relating to injury of the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve were evaluated in 110 patients six months after they underwent anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using hamstring tendons. They were divided into two groups: one in which only the semitendinosus was used and the other, the semitendinosus and gracilis. Results The group in which only the semitendinosus was used as a graft presented a nerve injury rate of 36.1%. In the group in which the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons were used, 58.1% of the patients presented altered sensitivity. In the general assessment on all the patients, the nerve injury rate was 50.9%. Conclusion Harvesting the semitendinosus alone and using it in triple form is a viable option for ACL reconstruction and may give rise to fewer nerve injuries relating to branches of the saphenous nerve.

AB  - Purpose To investigate the information quality available on YouTube regarding rehabilitation and return to sport (RTS) after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Methods By use of The Onion Router software and predefined search terms, 140 YouTube videos regarding rehabilitation and RTS after ACLR were systematically included. Three scoring systems were used to analyze the included videos: (1) Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmark criteria; (2) Global Quality Score (GQS); and (3) self-developed scores for rehabilitation after ACLR and RTS after ACLR, following American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guidelines and current evidence. Results The vast majority of the included videos offered poor information quality, reliability, and accuracy. Videos that were uploaded by medically trained professionals showed significantly higher information quality regarding rehabilitation (P = .006 for JAMA score, P Conclusions The average information quality, reliability, and accuracy of YouTube videos regarding rehabilitation and RTS after ACLR are poor. The information quality of related YouTube videos from medically trained professionals is significantly higher compared with commercial videos or personal-testimony videos. Clinical Relevance Current YouTube videos regarding rehabilitation and RTS after ACLR do not meet the necessary quality standards. Physicians should also be able to provide alternative sources of high-quality information.

TI  - Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and knee osteoarthritis.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is a traumatic event that can lead to significant functional impairment and inability to participate in high-level sports-related activities. ACL reconstruction is considered the treatment of choice for symptomatic ACL-deficient patients and can assist in full functional recovery. Furthermore, ACL reconstruction restores ligamentous stability to normal, and, therefore, can potentially fully reinstate kinematics of the knee joint. As a consequence, the natural history of ACL injury could be potentially reversed via ACL reconstruction. Evidence from the literature is controversial regarding the effectiveness of ACL reconstruction in preventing the development of knee cartilage degeneration. This editorial aims to present recent high-level evidence in an attempt to answer whether ACL injury inevitably leads to osteoarthritis and whether ACL reconstruction can prevent this development or not.

TI  - Effects of Sex on Compensatory Landing Strategies Upon Return to Sport After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction
PY  - 2011
AB  - Study Design Controlled laboratory, cross-sectional, cohort design. Objective To determine if a sex-specific pattern of lower limb asymmetries is present during a drop vertical jump (DVJ) maneuver at the time of return to sport after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Background A high incidence of second ACL injury is reported after reconstruction; however, the underlying mechanisms of this injury are unclear. While asymmetrical dynamic loading patterns predictive of primary ACL injury in healthy female athletes were observed in female athletes 2 years after ACL reconstruction, it is unknown if similar asymmetries are present in male athletes after ACL reconstruction at the time of return to sport. Methods A total of 98 participants were included in the study, 56 of whom had unilateral ACL reconstruction (35 female, 21 male) and had been released to return to unrestricted level 1 and 2 sports, and 42 of whom were uninjured, activity-matched control participants (29 female, 13 male).

TI  - Alarming underutilisation of rehabilitation in athletes with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: four ways to change the game.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Alarming underutilisation of rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction (ACLR) was highlighted in a recent study.1 These Australian trends are not unique, but support the emerging realisation that athletes may be overtreated with ACLR surgery, but undertreated when it comes to rehabilitation. We use the term undertreated to describe insufficient rehabilitation—either because athletes are discharged too soon or because the rehabilitation content is inadequate.

Among non-elite athletes with ACLR, only 5% received rehabilitation1 that followed evidence-based guidelines2: ≥6 months’ rehabilitation, including agility and landing exercises, and a structured return to sport (RTS). Most athletes were undertreated: 45% (50 of 111) never saw a clinician after the third postoperative month and 70% (78 of 111) never did agility or landing exercises.1 When clinical practice does not follow evidence-based guidelines, we are not offering the best to our athletes.

Outcomes following ACLR are mainly dictated by the athlete, the rehabilitation clinician and the orthopaedic surgeon. And the rehabilitation clinician might be the central player in this trifecta.1 Almost a year …

TI  - Principles of brain plasticity in improving sensorimotor function of the knee and leg in patients with anterior cruciate ligament injury: a double-blind randomized exploratory trial
PY  - 2012
AB  - Background: Severe traumatic knee injury, including injury to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), leads to impaired sensorimotor function. Although improvements are achieved by training, impairment often persists. Because good sensorimotor function is associated with better patient-reported function and a potential lower risk of future joint problems, more effective treatment is warranted. Temporary cutaneous anesthesia of adjacent body parts was successfully used on the hand and foot to improve sensorimotor function. The aim of this study was to test whether this principle of brain plasticity could be used on the knee. The hypothesis was that temporary anesthesia of the skin area above and below the knee would improve sensorimotor function of the ipsilateral knee and leg in subjects with ACL injury. Methods: In this double-blind exploratory study, 39 subjects with ACL injury (mean age 24 years, SD 5.2, 49% women, mean 52 weeks after injury or reconstruction) and self-reported functional limitations and lack of trust in the knee were randomized to temporary local cutaneous application of anesthetic (EMLA W )( n=20) or placebo cream (n=19). Fifty grams of EMLA W , or placebo, was applied on the leg 10 cm above and 10 cm below the center of patella, leaving the area around the knee without cream. Measures of sensory function (perception of touch, vibration sense, knee kinesthesia) and motor function (knee muscle strength, hop test) were assessed before and after 90 minutes of treatment with EMLA W or placebo. The paired t-test was used for comparisons within groups and analysis of variance between groups, except for ordinal data where the Wilcoxon signed rank test, or Mann–Whitney test, was used. The number of subjects needed was determined by an a priori sample size calculation. Results: No statistically significant or clinically relevant differences were seen over time (before vs. after) in the measures of sensory or motor functions in the EMLA W group or in the placebo group. There were no differences between the groups due to treatment effect (EMLA W vs. placebo). Conclusions: Temporary cutaneous anesthesia of adjacent body parts had no effect in improving sensorimotor function of the knee and leg in subjects with severe traumatic knee ligament injury.

TI  - Are Muscle Strength and Function of the Uninjured Lower Limb Weakened After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury? Two-Year Follow-up After Reconstruction
PY  - 2015
AB  - Background:After an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, the uninjured contralateral lower limb may become weakened because of neuromuscular changes, proprioceptive deficits, and disuse of the limb; this weakness predisposes the limb to ACL injury. However, no results have been reported regarding weakness in the contralateral limb after ACL injury.Hypothesis:Muscle strength and functional status of the contralateral lower limb are reduced after unilateral ACL injury.Study Design:Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.Methods:The ACL group consisted of 75 patients who underwent primary unilateral ACL reconstruction and were followed at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. A group of 75 healthy individuals (controls) were matched one-to-one with the ACL group for age, sex, body mass index, and initial Tegner activity level. The side that was evaluated in each control subject corresponded to the injured limb in the matched ACL subject. Isokinetic muscle strength, including extension peak torque per body ...

Very-low certainty evidence suggests increased odds of structural OA related to ACLR+cartilage injury (OR=2.31; 95% CI 1.35 to 3.94), ACLR+partial meniscectomy (OR=1.87; 1.45 to 2.42) and ACLR+total medial meniscectomy (OR=3.14; 2.20 to 4.48).

An average of 13.5 years after ACL reconstruction with bone–patellar tendon–bone (BTB) autograft, 73 patients were evaluated. Inclusion criteria consisted of an isolated ACL rupture and reconstruction with BPTB graft with no associated intra-articular lesions, in particular, cartilage alterations or meniscal lesions. Clinical assessment was performed using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Tegner and Lysholm scores. Instrumental anterior laxity testing was carried out with the KT–1000™ arthrometer. Degree of degenerative changes and prevalence of OA were determined using the Kellgren- Lawrence scale. Mean follow-up was 13.5 years. Mean age was 43.8 years. About 75% of patients were graded A or B according to the IKDC score. The Lysholm score was 90.2 ± 4.8. Radiological assessment reported degenerative changes of grade II OA in 54.2% of patients. Prevalence of grades III or IV OA was found in 20%. The incidence of OA was significantly correlated with stability and function at long-term follow-up. Arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using BPTB autograft resulted in a high degree of patient satisfaction and good clinical results on long-term follow-up. A higher degree of OA developed in 20% of patients and was significantly correlated with increased anterior laxity at long-term follow-up.

TI  - Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice Guidelines Linked to the International Classification of Functioning Disability, and Health from the Orhopaedic Section of the American Physical Therapy Association
PY  - 2012
AB  - P ain under the kneecap, also known as anterior knee pain or patellofemoral pain, is one of the most common reasons why active people seek healthcare. Each year, 2.5 million runners are diagnosed with patellofemoral pain. Unfortunately, 74% of people with this problem will decrease their overall physical activity levels for at least 5 years after the initial injury, and 70% to 90% of them will experience more than 1 episode of pain. Recently, a panel of 50 experts from 9 countries gathered in Belgium to discuss the potential causes of and best treatments for this condition. A synopsis of this meeting is published in the June 2012 issue of JOSPT and provides new insights and discussion of evidence-based treatments for those who have knee pain.

TI  - Relationship between the deep flexion of the knee joint and the dynamics of the infrapatellar fat pad after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction via ultrasonography
PY  - 2019
AB  - [Purpose] A sufficient flexion angle of the knee joint after knee surgery leads to higher quality of their life; therefore, here we investigated the relationship between the dynamics of the infrapatellar fat pad and seiza-style sitting via ultrasonography. [Participants and Methods] Twenty-eight patients were enrolled 3 months post-operatively after anterior cruciate reconstruction. They were divided into a "possible" group and "impossible" group, according to whether they could sit in the seiza style. The thickness of the superficial part of the infrapatellar fat pad was measured at 10° and 90° knee flexion on reconstructed knees in the sitting position via ultrasound evaluation. Images were taken to capture the patella apex and tibial tuberosity. The thickness of the superficial part of the infrapatellar fat pad was measured, and the thickness change ratio was calculated. The characteristics of each group were compared. [Results] The superficial part of the infrapatellar fat pad was significantly thinner in the possible group at a 10° knee flexion. The thickness change ratio of the infrapatellar fat pad was significantly greater in the possible group. [Conclusion] The thickness of the infrapatellar fat pad at a 10° knee flexion and the thickness change ratio of the infrapatellar fat pad could affect the possibility of sitting in the seiza style.

TI  - Primary ankle ligament augmentation versus modified Brostrom-Gould procedure: a 2-year randomized controlled trial.
PY  - 2014
AB  - Background

More than 20% of patients develop chronic instability following appropriate management of an ‘ankle sprain’. There is little research comparing surgical techniques. ‘Anatomical’ procedures, such as the modified Brostrom-Gould (MBG), are generally preferred. However, not all patients are suitable for this procedure. Augmentation of a primary repair using a synthetic ligament, such as the ligament augmentation reconstruction system (LARS), is another ‘anatomic’ option. Our objective was to compare the clinical outcome following the MBG with that following the LARS technique using a prospective randomized clinical trial.



Methods

Patients who satisfied the study criteria were randomly allocated to undergo the LARS procedure or the MBG procedure. All patients followed a similar rehabilitation programme. Patients completed the foot and ankle outcome score (FAOS) before surgery, and then at 1 year and 2 years following surgery. Statistical analysis was used to compare the groups (P < 0.05).



Results

Forty-one patients took part in the study, 21 were randomized to the LARS group and 20 to the MBG group. The LARS group had a significantly better improvement in the total FAOS at both 1 year (25.5 standard error (SE) 3.8 versus 16.0 SE 3.3) and 2 years (27.1 SE 4.5 versus 15.8 SE 4.9) post-surgery.



Conclusion

Primary repair combined with LARS results in better patient-scored clinical outcome, at 2 years post-surgery, than the MBG procedure. Although longer follow-up is required, the LARS procedure may be considered as an alternative, especially in those patients for whom the MBG is relatively contra-indicated.

TI  - The Effect of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction on Stride-to-Stride Variability
PY  - 2009
AB  - Purpose The purpose of our study was to investigate the functional outcome after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using bone–patellar tendon–bone (BPTB) and quadrupled semitendinosus and gracilis tendon (ST/G) autografts by evaluating stride-to-stride variability. Methods Six patients with BPTB and 6 patients with STG ACL reconstruction, 2 years postoperatively, and 6 healthy control subjects walked on a treadmill at a self-selected pace while 2 minutes of continuous kinematic data were recorded with a 6-camera optoelectronic system. Stride-to-stride variability was calculated from the knee flexion/extension data using the nonlinear measure of approximate entropy, which estimates the regularity of movement patterns over time. Results ACL reconstruction affects stride-to-stride variability. Both the BPTB and the ST/G groups had significantly larger approximate entropy values than the healthy controls. No differences were found between the BPTB and the ST/G approximate entropy values. Conclusions After ACL reconstruction using either BPTB or quadrupled ST/G, there is increased gait variability as compared to healthy individuals. This could be caused by the altered neuromuscular activity found in ACL-reconstructed limbs. Level of Evidence Level III, case control study.

TI  - ACL Reconstruction Combined With the Arnold-Coker Modification of the MacIntosh Lateral Extra-articular Tenodesis: Long-term Clinical and Radiological Outcomes.
PY  - 2021
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Interest in the role of lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET) in preventing rotatory instability and the pivot-shift phenomenon after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) has been recently renewed. Nevertheless, there is still concern about overconstraint of the lateral compartment of the knee and the risk of subsequent osteoarthritis (OA).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">The purpose of this retrospective study was to compare long-term subjective and objective outcomes and the rate of OA development between patients undergoing isolated ACLR (iACLR) with a hamstring tendon autograft and those with a combined Arnold-Coker modification of the McIntosh extra-articular procedure. Risk factors for long-term OA were evaluated.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN" NlmCategory="METHODS">Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">The study included 165 consecutive patients treated at a single center by ACLR. A total of 86 patients underwent iACLR (iACLR group) and 79 received combined intra- and extra-articular reconstruction (ACLR+LET). The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Lysholm, and Tegner activity scores were administered. Knee stability was tested through the Lachman test, the pivot-shift test, and the KT-1000 knee arthrometer test. A positive pivot-shift test (++/+++), laxity on the KT-1000, and referred giving-way episodes or revision ACLR were considered failures. Radiographic results were assessed according to the Fairbank, IKDC, and Kellgren-Lawrence scales. Radiographic evaluation included both the overall tibiofemoral joint and the medial and lateral compartment separately. A univariate and a multivariate logistic regression with penalized maximum likelihood was used to identify risks factors associated with long-term OA.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The mean follow-up was 15.7 years. There were no statistically significant differences in subjective scores between the 2 groups. A side-to-side difference &gt;5 mm on the KT-1000 arthrometer evaluation was found in 8 patients in the iACLR group and in 1 patient in the ACLR+LET group (<i>P</i> = .01). Nine cases of failure were found in the iACLR group and only 1 case was found in the ACLR+LET group (<i>P</i> = .0093). Patients in the iACLR group had a significantly higher OA grades than those in the ACLR+LET group for the overall tibiofemoral joint and the lateral compartment of the knee. No differences were found in the medial compartment. A higher level of lateral compartment OA was found in patients who received partial lateral meniscectomy in the iACLR group compared with those in the ACLR+LET group. Univariate and multivariate analysis results demonstrated that meniscectomy was the most significant factor for long-term OA development.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">A significantly higher risk of long-term OA was found with iACLR than with ACLR combined with the Arnold-Coker modification of the McIntosh extra-articular procedure. Knees with combined ACLR also had a significantly lower OA grade after partial lateral meniscectomy. Additionally, those undergoing combined ACLR had better knee stability and lower graft rupture rates at the long-term follow-up. Partial meniscectomy was the main risk factor negatively associated with OA changes.</AbstractText>

TI  - Efficacy of β-Tricalcium Phosphate Graft into the Bone Defects after Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.
PY  - 2016
AB  - This prospective pilot study investigated whether grafting β-tricalcium phosphate (B-TCP) into the bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB)-harvesting site after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction would accelerate bone and tendon regeneration in the grafted site. Overall, 19 patients agreed prospectively to undergo regular morphological and histological examinations of the B-TCP-grafted site. Postoperative radiographic, ultrasonographic, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations were performed to evaluate the grafted site at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Postoperative knee function and donor-site morbidity were assessed at 12 months using the kneeling test. A histological examination was also performed at this time Radiographic examination and MRI showed that the grafted B-TCP was completely absorbed and remodeled into normal bone structure in the tibia and patella at 6 months postoperatively. Histological and ultrasonographic examinations of all subjects showed that the grafted B-TCP was substituted by normal bone tissue, and the patellar tendon − bone junction had regenerated at 12 months postoperatively. Clinical functional knee tests showed good recovery of the donor site. All patients could perform kneeling and knee walking on hard ground. The results of this pilot study suggest that grafting B-TCP into the BPTB-harvesting site promotes the remodeling process of the bone and patellar tendon structures. This surgical treatment would decrease an incidence of the anterior knee pain after ACLR using a BPTB autograft.

TI  - Midterm results of combined intra- and extra-articular ACL reconstruction compared to historical ACL reconstruction data. Multicenter study of the French Arthroscopy Society.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract Introduction During anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction procedures, anterolateral reconstruction (ALR) can also be performed to improve the knee's rotational stability. However, the effectiveness of this supplemental technique and its impact on the risk of retears and on the onset of secondary degenerative changesare controversial. Hypothesis ALR improves control over the pivot shift, reduces the retear risk and delays the appearance of secondary degenerative lesions. Material and methods Clinical examination, knee laxity measurements and X-ray evaluations were done in 478 patients with more than 3 years’ follow-up after combined ACL and ALR from 11 participating hospitals. The mean patient age at the time of surgery was 28 years. Eighty-eight percent of the patients participated in pivot sports and 45% were competitive athletes. The findings of this study were compared to historical isolated ACL reconstruction data. Results The average follow-up was 6.8 years. No detectable pivot shift was found in 83% of patients, while 12.8% of patient had a smooth glide. The side-to-side difference in anteroposterior knee laxity with maximum manual force was less than 3 mm in 66% of patients and less than 5 mm in 95%. The retear rate was 5.4%, with half of these patients undergoing revision ACL surgery. Secondary meniscus damage requiring surgery occurred in 6.3% of patients; the radiological osteoarthritis rate was 17.5%. Discussion When compared to historical ACL reconstruction data, combined intra- and extra-articular reconstruction does not increase the complication rate. At a mean follow-up of 6.8 years, it provides better control over the pivot shift along with a low retear rate and low occurrence of secondary meniscus injuries. Level of evidence IV, multicenter study.

TI  - Mechanisms, prediction, and prevention of ACL injuries: Cut risk with three sharpened and validated tools.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Economic and societal pressures influence modern medical practice to develop and implement prevention strategies. Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury devastates the knee joint leading to short term disability and long term sequelae. Due to the high risk of long term osteoarthritis in all treatment populations following ACL injury, prevention is the only effective intervention for this life-altering disruption in knee health. The "Sequence of Prevention" Model provides a framework to monitor progress towards the ultimate goal of preventing ACL injuries. Utilizing this model, our multidisciplinary collaborative research team has spent the last decade working to delineate injury mechanisms, identify injury risk factors, predict which athletes are at-risk for injury, and develop ACL injury prevention programs. Within this model of injury prevention, modifiable factors (biomechanical and neuromuscular) related to injury mechanisms likely provide the best opportunity for intervention strategies aimed to decrease the risk of ACL injury, particularly in female athletes. Knowledge advancements have led to the development of potential solutions that allow athletes to compete with lowered risk of ACL injury. Design and integration of personalized clinical assessment tools and targeted prevention strategies for athletes at high risk for ACL injury may transform current prevention practices and ultimately significantly reduce ACL injury incidence. This 2016 OREF Clinical Research Award focuses on the authors' work and contributions to the field. The author's acknowledge the many research groups who have contributed to the current state of knowledge in the fields of ACL injury mechanisms, injury risk screening and injury prevention strategies. © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

TI  - Infographic. ACL injury journey: an education aid
PY  - 2021
AB  - After an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, patients report feeling angry, depressed, frustrated and uncertain about their future.1 It is recommended that patients and practitioners engage in shared decision-making to ensure an informed choice about treatment is reached.2 Unfortunately, there are limited resources to help patients navigate treatment decisions and set expectations following an ACL injury. We coproduced an infographic (see figures 1 and 2), with input from patients about content and design, to present the best available evidence in an easy to digest format. This infographic (separated into two parts) is an education aid, designed to be used with a health professional, to reduce uncertainty, enhance communication and assist in shared decision-making. Broadly, it aims to cover:



Patients need a clear appraisal of the evidence, to make an informed decision about whether to have ACL reconstruction (ACLR) or not following ACL injury. …

TI  - The Effect of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction on the Progression of Osteoarthritis
PY  - 2012
AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament rupture (ACL) is a common injury, particularly among young sporting adults. Early onset osteoarthritis (OA) can be a devastating and difficult to manage consequence of such an injury. The techniques for reconstructing the ACL are advancing all the time, but the effect that this has on the progression of OA is less well understood. Many factors affect the development of OA following an ACL injury, including direct and indirect trauma to the articular cartilage, associated meniscal injuries, chronic tibiofemoral joint instability, and multiple enzymatic pathways. This review will summarize the current evidence surrounding each of these areas, and describe some of the recent developments that may have an impact on the management of these injuries in the future.

TI  - Patient-Related Risk Factors for ACL Graft Failure
PY  - 2013
AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament tears are a devastating injury to athletes commonly encountered in pivoting and cutting sports. Reconstruction of the ACL is generally performed to restore stability and return the athlete to a healthy and active lifestyle. Numerous risk factors for primary ACL tear have been identified including sex, activity level, anatomic variables, and neuromuscular control. ACL graft failure has been related to poor surgical technique, trauma, failure of biological incorporation, graft type, infection, and undiagnosed concurrent knee injury. There has been limited investigation, however, into patient-related risk factors for re-tear of grafts following ACL reconstruction. An understanding of these risk factors would enable clinicians to better counsel patients on their expected outcomes. This chapter reviews activity level, sex, age, biomechanical factors, and neuromuscular control as risk factors for graft failure after primary ACL reconstruction. Activity level and age have been shown to be significant risk factors for re-tear of ACL grafts. Athletes returning to high-level pivoting and cutting sports should be counseled on the increased risk of graft failure.

PY  - 2013
AB  - Background:Bone–patellar tendon–bone (BPTB) is a common autograft and allograft source used for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.

TI  - Fifty-five per cent return to competitive sport following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis including aspects of physical functioning and contextual factors
PY  - 2014
AB  - Background The aim of this study was to update our original systematic review of return to sport rates following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery.

Method Electronic databases were searched from April 2010 to November 2013 for articles reporting the number of patients returning to sport following ACL reconstruction surgery. Return to sport rates, physical functioning and contextual data were extracted and combined using random-effects meta-analyses. Data from the original review (articles published up to April 2010) were combined with data from the updated search.

Results Sixty-nine articles, reporting on 7556 participants, were reviewed. On average, 81% of people returned to any sport, 65% returned to their preinjury level of sport and 55% returned to competitive level sport after surgery. Symmetrical hopping performance (d=0.3) and the contextual factors of younger age (d=−0.3), male gender (OR=1.4), playing elite sport (OR=2.5) and having a positive psychological response (d=0.3) favoured returning to the preinjury level sport. Receiving a hamstring tendon autograft favoured returning to competitive level sport (OR=2.4), whereas receiving a patellar tendon autograft favoured returning to the preinjury level sport (OR=1.2).

Conclusions Returning to sport varied according to different physical functioning and contextual factors, which could warrant additional emphasis in postoperative rehabilitation programmes to maximise participation.

TI  - Quadriceps tendon autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a comprehensive review of current literature and systematic review of clinical results.
PY  - 2014
AB  - Purpose The autograft of choice for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction remains controversial. Recently, there has been an increase in interest in the quadriceps tendon as an autologous graft option for ACL reconstruction. The purposes of this study were to provide an in-depth review of quadriceps tendon anatomy, histology, and biomechanics and to synthesize reported clinical outcomes of ACL reconstructions using quadriceps tendon autografts. We hypothesize that (1) published studies on the anatomic, histologic, and biomechanical data regarding the quadriceps tendon support its use as a graft option for ACL reconstruction and (2) clinical outcomes of ACL reconstruction using quadriceps tendon autograft have similar clinical outcomes to bone–patellar tendon–bone autografts with less donor-site morbidity. Methods We performed a comprehensive review of the literature regarding the anatomy, histology, and biomechanical studies of the quadriceps tendon, as well as a systematic review of clinical studies (Level of Evidence I-III) evaluating outcomes after ACL reconstruction using quadriceps tendon autograft. Stability outcomes, functional outcomes, range of motion, patient satisfaction, morbidity, and complications were comprised. Results Fourteen studies were included in the review of clinical results, including 1,154 ACL reconstructions with quadriceps tendon autograft. Six studies directly compared quadriceps tendon autografts (n = 383) with bone–patellar tendon–bone autografts (n = 484). Stability outcomes (Lachman, pivot-shift, and instrumented laxity testing), functional outcomes (International Knee Documentation Committee and Lysholm scores), overall patient satisfaction, range of motion, and complications were similar between quadriceps tendon and other graft options. Less donor-site morbidity was seen in patients who underwent quadriceps tendon ACL reconstructions. Conclusions Use of the quadriceps tendon autograft for ACL reconstruction is supported by current orthopaedic literature. It is a safe, reproducible, and versatile graft that should be considered in future studies of ACL reconstruction. Level of Evidence Level III, systematic review of Level I, II, and III studies.

TI  - Increased Hip and Knee Flexion During Landing Decreases Tibiofemoral Compressive Forces in Women Who Have Undergone Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction
PY  - 2012
AB  - Background:Those who have undergone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) have been shown to exhibit increased muscle co-contraction, decreased knee flexion, and elevated tibiofemoral compressive forces. Elevated tibiofemoral compressive forces may be associated with the high risk of developing knee osteoarthritis in this population.Purpose:To examine whether muscle co-contraction and tibiofemoral compressive forces in women after undergoing ACLR can be reduced through the use of a landing strategy that emphasizes greater hip and knee flexion.Study Design:Controlled laboratory study.Methods:Ten female recreational athletes who had previously undergone ACLR participated in this study. Participants performed a single-legged drop-land task before and after a training session that encouraged them to use greater hip and knee flexion during landing. Peak tibiofemoral compressive forces before and after training were estimated using an electromyography (EMG)–driven knee model that incorporated joint k...

TI  - Intratunnel versus extratunnel fixation of hamstring autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Purpose To determine which is more effective: intratunnel or extratunnel anterior cruciate ligament soft-tissue graft fixation. A secondary purpose was to determine whether groups displayed differing relations between objective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) grade and the timing of full weight bearing (FWB), jogging/running, and return to sports. The study hypotheses were that intratunnel fixation would display a greater percentage of normal or nearly normal objective IKDC grades and enable earlier FWB, return to jogging/running, and return to sports. Methods We performed a systematic review of prospective, Studies with Level I or II evidence published from 2000 to 2011 with at least 2 years' follow-up that used interference screw hamstring autograft fixation (intratunnel group) or button, staple, or post hamstring autograft fixation (extratunnel group) for primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. We also compared IKDC grades; Tegner and Lysholm scores; instrumented anterior laxity and pivot-shift test findings; timing of FWB, jogging/running, and return to sports; and modified Coleman Methodology Scores. Results The groups showed comparable modified Coleman Methodology Scores, objective IKDC grades, Lysholm and Tegner scores, instrumented anterior laxity and pivot-shift test findings, and return-to-sports timing. The intratunnel group displayed earlier FWB and jogging/running; however, return-to-sports timing did not differ between groups. Early FWB and the percentage of patients with normal or nearly normal objective IKDC grades were directly related for the extratunnel group. Conclusions Patients who received intratunnel fixation were released earlier to FWB and jogging/running, supporting the study hypotheses. Groups did not differ in return-to-sports timing or objective IKDC grades, not supporting the study hypotheses. Early FWB in the extratunnel group was related to a greater percentage of patients having normal or nearly normal objective IKDC grades. Return-to-sports timing and having a normal objective IKDC grade were related in both groups; however, this relation was stronger with intratunnel fixation. Level of Evidence Level II, systematic review of Level I and II studies.

TI  - Anterior cruciate ligament injury and radiologic progression of knee osteoarthritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Background:Knee osteoarthritis after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury has previously been reported. However, there has been no meta-analysis reporting the development and progression of osteoarthritis.Purpose:We present the first meta-analysis reporting on the development and progression of osteoarthritis after ACL injury at a minimum mean follow-up of 10 years, using a single and widely accepted radiologic classification, the Kellgren & Lawrence classification.Study Design:Meta-analysis.Method:Articles were included for systematic review if they reported radiologic findings of ACL-injured knees and controls using the Kellgren & Lawrence classification at a minimum mean follow-up period of 10 years. Appropriate studies were then included for meta-analysis.Results:Nine studies were included for systematic review, of which 6 studies were further included for meta-analysis. One hundred twenty-one of 596 (20.3%) ACL-injured knees had moderate or severe radiologic changes (Kellgren & Lawrence grade III ...

TI  - Why autologous hamstring tendon reconstruction should now be considered the gold standard for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in athletes
PY  - 2009
AB  - The aim of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructive surgery is to provide the patient with a timely return to sport allowing them to participate without any further meniscal damage and having a normal knee function which results in neither clinical nor radiologic evidence of osteoarthritis later in life. Long term study of both endoscopically performed patellar tendon and hamstring tendon graft reconstructions show that this is more likely to be achieved with hamstring tendon graft rather than patellar tendon graft.

ACL reconstruction carried out endoscopically with the patellar tendon graft was popularised last century in the late 1980s and early 1990s due to the advent of easily performed interference screw fixation, and the rapid bone to bone healing of the graft. However donor site morbidity was common, persistent, occasionally severe and particularly disabling in females and trades people who knelt. Longitudinal follow-up demonstrated the development of fixed flexion deformities at the 2 and 5 year post-operative mark associated with the development of Grade B changes in the patellofemoral and medial compartments.1 2 These changes were noted on side to side comparative radiographs. …

TI  - Exercise-therapy and education for individuals one year after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a pilot randomised controlled trial.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Guided rehabilitation beyond 6-months is rare following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), despite high prevalence of unacceptable symptoms and quality of life (QoL). Our primary aim was to determine the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluating a physiotherapist-guided intervention for individuals 1-year post-ACLR with persistent symptoms. Our secondary aim was to determine if a worthwhile treatment effect could be observed for the lower-limb focussed intervention (compared to the trunk-focussed intervention), for improvement in knee-related QoL, symptoms, and function. Participant- and assessor-blinded, pilot feasibility RCT. Participant eligibility criteria: i) 12–15 months post-ACLR; ii)  1 in 3 screened), recruitment rate (> 4 participants/month), retention (  80%). Between-group differences for knee-related QoL (KOOS-QoL, ACL-QoL), symptoms (KOOS-Pain, KOOS-Symptoms), and function (KOOS-Sport, functional performance tests) were used to verify that the worthwhile effect (greater than the minimal detectable change for each measure) was contained within the 95% confidence interval. 47% of those screened were eligible, and 27 participants (3 participants/month; 48% men, 34±12 years) were randomised. Two did not commence treatment, and two were lost to follow-up (16% drop-out). Physiotherapy attendance was > 80% for both groups but reported adherence to unsupervised exercise was low (< 55%). Both interventions had potentially worthwhile effects for KOOS-QoL and ACL-QoL, while the lower-limb focussed intervention had potentially greater effects for KOOS-Sport, KOOS-Pain, and functional performance. A larger-scale RCT is warranted. All feasibility criteria were met, or reasonable recommendations could be made to achieve the criteria in future trials. Strategies to increase recruitment rate and exercise adherence are required. The potential worthwhile effects for knee-related QoL, symptoms, and function indicates a fully-powered RCT may detect a clinically meaningful effect. Prospectively registered (

TI  - Magnesium ring device to restore function of a transected anterior cruciate ligament in the goat stifle joint
PY  - 2016
AB  - A bioresorbable, mono-crystalline magnesium (Mg) ring device and suture implantation technique were designed to connect the ends of a transected anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) to restabilize the knee and load the ACL to prevent disuse atrophy of its insertion sites and facilitate its healing. To test its application, cadaveric goat stifle joints were evaluated using a robotic/universal force-moment sensor testing system in three states: Intact, ACL-deficient, and after Mg ring repair, at 30°, 60°, and 90° of joint flexion. Under a 67-N anterior tibial load simulating that used in clinical examinations, the corresponding anterior tibial translation (ATT) and in-situ forces in the ACL and medial meniscus for 0 and 100 N of axial compression were obtained and compared with a control group treated with suture repair. In all cases, Mg ring repair reduced the ATT by over 50% compared to the ACL-deficient joint, and in-situ forces in the ACL and medial meniscus were restored to near normal levels, showing significant improvement over suture repair. These findings suggest that Mg ring repair could successfully stabilize the joint and load the ACL immediately after surgery, laying the framework for future in vivo studies to assess its utility for ACL healing. © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

TI  - COMPARATIVE STUDY OF ACL RECONSTRUCTION WITH ANATOMICAL POSITIONING OF THE TUNNELS USING THE PATELLAR TENDON VERSUS HAMSTRING TENDON
PY  - 2015
AB  - ABSTRACT Objective: To compare ACL reconstruction with anatomical positioning of the tunnels using the hamstring or patellar tendons. Methods: We prospectively evaluated 52 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using the Chambat's technique, with anatomical positioning of the tunnels drilled outside in. They were divided into group A, with 27 patients, using the patellar tendon as a graft, and group B, with 25 patients, using the hamstring. Results: In group A 26 patients were very satisfied or satisfied and 1 unhappy, in group B. 25 patients were very satisfied or satisfied with the procedure (p = 0.990). According to the Lysholm scale, group A had a mean score of 96.11 and group B, 95.32 (p=0.594). In relation to preoperative IKDC, 100% of the patients in group A and 92% of those in group B were IKDC C or D (p = 0.221); in the assessment with a minimum of two-year follow-up, 96% of group A and 92% of group B were IKDC A or B (p = 0.256). The Lachman test, pivot shift, return to sports activities, and the comparative difference in anterior translation (RolimeterTM) also showed no statistically significant difference. In group A, 5 patients (18.5%) were unable to kneel on a hard surface, whereas no patient in group B had this complaint. Conclusion: The anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction presents similar results using the hamstring or patellar tendon with anatomical positioning of the tunnels. Drilling the femoral tunnel outside in is a reproducible and accurate option in the correct placement the femoral tunnel.

TI  - Decreased Knee Joint Loading Associated With Early Knee Osteoarthritis After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury
PY  - 2015
AB  - Background:Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury predisposes individuals to early-onset knee joint osteoarthritis (OA). Abnormal joint loading is apparent after ACL injury and reconstruction. The relationship between altered joint biomechanics and the development of knee OA is unknown.Hypothesis:Altered knee joint kinetics and medial compartment contact forces initially after injury and reconstruction are associated with radiographic knee OA 5 years after reconstruction.Study Design:Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3.Methods:Individuals with acute, unilateral ACL injury completed gait analysis before (baseline) and after (posttraining) preoperative rehabilitation and at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after reconstruction. Surface electromyographic and knee biomechanical data served as inputs to an electromyographically driven musculoskeletal model to estimate knee joint contact forces. Patients completed radiographic testing 5 years after reconstruction. Differences in knee joint kinetics and conta...

TI  - The Impact of Quadriceps Femoris Strength Asymmetry on Functional Performance at Return to Sport Following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction
PY  - 2012
AB  - Study Design Cross-sectional study. Objectives To investigate the impact of quadriceps femoris (QF) muscle strength asymmetry at the time of return to sport on self-reported function and functional performance of individuals following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Background Evidence-based QF strength guidelines for return-to-sport decision making are lacking. Objective guidelines necessitate understanding the impact of QF strength deficits at the time of return to sport on function and performance. Methods Fifty-five individuals (mean age, 17.3 years) who were cleared for return to sport following primary ACLR (ACLR group) and 35 uninjured individuals (mean age, 17.0 years) in a control group participated in the study. QF strength (maximum voluntary isometric contraction) was assessed, and the quadriceps index (QI) was calculated [(involved strength/uninvolved strength) × 100%]. The ACLR group was further subdivided into 2 groups, based on the QI: high quadriceps (QI of 90% or greater...

TI  - Recent advances following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: rehabilitation perspectives : Critical reviews in rehabilitation medicine.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament are common. Surgical reconstruction is more prevalent than ever. This review article discusses treatment of the patient following surgical reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament. Various phases of rehabilitation are discussed with emphasis on early return of passive motion, early weight bearing, bracing, kinetic chain exercises, neuromuscular electrical stimulation and accelerated rehabilitation. Although evidence exists for the treatment of the surgically reconstructed cruciate ligament, more is needed to better define specific timeframes for advancement. Evidence exists that many of these young individuals are not fully returning to unlimited high level activities. This review article presents some of the latest evidence regarding anterior cruciate ligament rehabilitation in an attempt to help the busy clinician understand and relate basic and clinical research to rehabilitation of a patient following reconstruction.

TI  - Minimum Two-Year Follow-up of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in Patients with Generalized Joint Laxity
PY  - 2018
AB  - Background The purposes of this investigation were to compare outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction between patients with generalized joint laxity and those without it and to investigate the effect of generalized joint laxity on outcomes of ACL reconstruction from 2 to 8 years postoperatively. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 163 patients who had undergone unilateral ACL reconstruction from January 2001 to December 2008. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to presence or absence of generalized joint laxity. The proportions of patients with meniscectomy, graft rupture, and contralateral ACL rupture were compared. Rupture rates were compared with Kaplan-Meier analysis. The Lachman test, pivot-shift test, and anterior translation measured with the KT-2000 arthrometer were evaluated. The Lysholm knee score and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score were compared. The IKDC objective grade and radiographic grade were also evaluated. Follow-up assessments were performed at 2, 5, and 8 years postoperatively. Results The proportions of meniscectomy, graft rupture, and contralateral ACL rupture in patients with generalized joint laxity were higher than in patients without generalized joint laxity during the whole evaluation period. However, differences in proportions and cumulative rupture rates did not reach significance (p > 0.05). Patients with generalized joint laxity had less stability and poorer functional outcomes at the 8-year follow-up compared with patients without generalized joint laxity. With regard to the Lachman test and anterior translation, poorer results were shown in patients with generalized joint laxity than in patients without generalized joint laxity during the whole evaluation period. The results of pivot-shift testing differed significantly at 5 years (p = 0.002) and 8 years (p = 0.007). Patients with generalized joint laxity also had worse Lysholm knee scores and IKDC subjective scores during the whole evaluation period; these differences may not be clinically important. Comparisons between serial outcomes measured at 2, 5, and 8-year follow-ups within each patient group showed that anterior translation (p = 0.002), Lysholm knee score (p = 0.014), and IKDC subjective score (p = 0.002) deteriorated over time, although the values at 8 years were similar to those at 5 years, in patients with generalized joint laxity. Conclusions Generalized joint laxity as an inherent physiologic characteristic of patients was related to a significant adverse effect on stability and functional outcomes of ACL reconstruction for patients followed for 2 to 8 years. Generalized joint laxity should be considered a risk factor for poor outcomes after ACL reconstruction. Level of evidence Therapeutic Level III.

TI  - Functional tissue engineering of ligament healing
PY  - 2010
AB  - Ligaments and tendons are dense connective tissues that are important in transmitting forces and facilitate joint articulation in the musculoskeletal system. Their injury frequency is high especially for those that are functional important, like the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and medial collateral ligament (MCL) of the knee as well as the glenohumeral ligaments and the rotator cuff tendons of the shoulder. Because the healing responses are different in these ligaments and tendons after injury, the consequences and treatments are tissue- and site-specific. In this review, we will elaborate on the injuries of the knee ligaments as well as using functional tissue engineering (FTE) approaches to improve their healing. Specifically, the ACL of knee has limited capability to heal, and results of non-surgical management of its midsubstance rupture have been poor. Consequently, surgical reconstruction of the ACL is regularly performed to gain knee stability. However, the long-term results are not satisfactory besides the numerous complications accompanied with the surgeries. With the rapid development of FTE, there is a renewed interest in revisiting ACL healing. Approaches such as using growth factors, stem cells and scaffolds have been widely investigated. In this article, the biology of normal and healing ligaments is first reviewed, followed by a discussion on the issues related to the treatment of ACL injuries. Afterwards, current promising FTE methods are presented for the treatment of ligament injuries, including the use of growth factors, gene delivery, and cell therapy with a particular emphasis on the use of ECM bioscaffolds. The challenging areas are listed in the future direction that suggests where collection of energy could be placed in order to restore the injured ligaments and tendons structurally and functionally.

TI  - Biomechanical Outcomes of Bridge-enhanced Anterior Cruciate Ligament Repair Are Influenced by Sex in a Preclinical Model.
PY  - 2015
AB  - Background
Despite the well-established role of sex on the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk, its effects on ACL surgical outcomes remain controversial. This is particularly critical when developing novel surgical techniques to treat the injury because there are limited data existing on how these procedures will respond in each sex. One such approach is bridge-enhanced ACL repair, in which primary suture repair of the ACL is augmented with a bioactive scaffold saturated with autologous blood. It has shown comparable biomechanical outcomes to ACL reconstruction in preclinical models.

TI  - Bilateral simultaneous anterior cruciate ligament rupture and reconstruction
PY  - 2023
AB  - Unilateral anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions account for approximately 100,000/year injuries in the USA. Those injuries are frequent and have precise management for restoring knee stability and functionality. Bilateral simultaneous ACL injuries are considered rare in orthopedic sports traumatology and no management guidelines for the reconstruction have been described in the current literature. We report the case of a 46-years-old male individual who presented to our department with a history of trauma in both knees which occurred during soccer games. After physical examination and an MRI scan the patient was diagnosed with bilateral ACL rupture. As bilateral ruptures are rare, there is a lack of guidelines for the management of such cases. In this case we opted for a simultaneous single-bundle ACL reconstruction. An autologous hamstrings graft (semitendinosus-gracilis) was used for the reconstruction. Full range of motion (ROM) was achieved at approximately 6 months after the surgery. Even with a lack of surgery guidelines and management guidelines, a simultaneous single-setting reconstruction showed good outcomes and no complications in the presented case. While both staged and single-setting reconstructions are considered viable in a bilateral injury, risks and benefits regarding the two management alternatives should be clearly explained to the patient, highlighting the postoperative and rehabilitation particularities for each option.

TI  - Safety of the application of Rigidfix cross-pin system via different tibial tunnels for tibial fixation during anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2020
AB  - We investigate the safety of the application of the Rigidfix cross-pin system via different tibial tunnels in the tibial fixation during anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Five adult fresh cadaver knees were fixed with the Rigidfix cross-pins in the tibial fixation site during ACL reconstruction. Two different tibial tunnel groups were established: in group A, the tunnel external aperture was placed at the 25° angle of coronal section; in group B, the tunnel external aperture was placed at the 45° angle of coronal section. The guide was placed at the plane 0.5 mm below articular facet through the tibial tunnel, with three rotation positions set at 0°, 30°, and 60° slopes. The incidences of iatrogenic injuries at tibial plateau cartilage (TPC), medial collateral ligament (MCL), and patellar tendon in three different slope angles were calculated in groups A and B and the results were analyzed by using chi square test. The iatrogenic injuries at MCL, TPC, and patellar tendon could occur after the Rigidfix cross-pin system was placed 5 mm below tibial plateau cartilage for ACL reconstruction. The incidences of TPC injury (χ2 = 5.662, P = 0.017) and MCL injury (P = 0.048, Fisher exact probability method) were significantly lower in group A than in group B. However, the incidence of patellar tendon injury showed no significant difference between these two groups (χ2 = 0.120, P = 0.729). When the Rigidfix cross-pin system is used for ACL reconstruction at the tibial fixation site, the external aperture of tibial tunnel should not be placed at the excessively posterosuperior site, to avoid MCL and TPC injuries.

TI  - Biomechanical evaluation of an allograft fixation system for ACL reconstruction.
PY  - 2022
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the biomechanical stability, especially graft slippage of an allograft screw and a conventional interference screw for tibial implant fixation in ACL reconstruction. Twenty-four paired human proximal tibia specimens underwent ACL reconstruction, with the graft in one specimen of each pair fixed using the allograft screw and the other using the conventional interference screw. Specimens were subjected to cyclic tensile loading until failure. The two fixation methods did not show any statistical difference in load at graft slippage (<i>p</i> = 0.241) or estimated mean survival until slippage onset (<i>p</i> = 0.061). The ultimate load and the estimated mean survival until failure were higher for the interference screw (<i>p</i> = 0.04, and <i>p</i> = 0.018, respectively). Graft displacement at ultimate load reached values of up to 7.2 (interference screw) and 11.3 mm (allograft screw). The allograft screw for implant fixation in ACL reconstruction demonstrated comparable behavior in terms of graft slippage to the interference screw but underperformed in terms of ultimate load. However, the ultimate load, occurring at progressive graft slippage, may not be considered a direct indicator of clinical failure.

TI  - Radiation risk from fluoroscopically-assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
PY  - 2010
AB  - INTRODUCTIONPrecise tunnel positioning is crucial for success in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. The use of intra-operative fluoroscopy has been shown to improve the accuracy of tunnel placement. Although radiation exposure is a concern, we lack information on the radiation risk to patients undergoing fluoroscopically-assisted ACL reconstruction with a standard C-arm. The aim of our study was to determine the mean radiation doses received by our patients. PATIENTS AND METHODSRadiation doses were recorded for 18 months between 1 April 2007 and 30 September 2008 for 58 consecutive patients undergoing ACL reconstruction assisted by intra-operative fluoroscopy. Dose area product (DAP) values were used to calculate the entrance skin dose (ESD), an indicator of potential skin damage and the effective dose (ED), an indicator of long-term cancer risk, for each patient. RESULTSThe median age of 58 patients included in data analysis was 28 years (range, 14–52 years), of whom 44 were male (76%). The...

TI  - The Association Between Race/Ethnicity and Revision Following ACL Reconstruction in a Universally Insured Cohort
PY  - 2019
AB  - Background There have been few large studies involving multiethnic cohorts of patients treated with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), and therefore, little is known about the role that race/ethnicity may play in the differential risk of undergoing revision surgery following primary ACLR. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether differences exist by race/ethnicity in the risk of undergoing the elective procedure of aseptic revision in a universally insured cohort of patients who had undergone ACLR. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study conducted using our integrated health-care system's ACLR registry and including primary ACLRs from 2008 to 2015. Race/ethnicity was categorized into the following 4 groups: non-Hispanic white, black, Hispanic, and Asian. Multivariable Cox proportional-hazard models were used to evaluate the association between race/ethnicity and revision risk while adjusting for age, sex, highest educational attainment, annual household income, graft type, and geographic region in which the ACLR was performed. Results Of the 27,258 included patients,13,567 (49.8%) were white, 7,713 (28.3%) were Hispanic, 3,725 (13.7%) were Asian, and 2,253 (8.3%) were black. Asian patients (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.57 to 0.90) and Hispanic patients (HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.70 to 0.98) had a lower risk of undergoing revision surgery than did white patients. Within the first 3.5 years postoperatively, we did not observe a difference in revision risk when black patients were compared with white patients (HR = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.64 to 1.14); after 3.5 years postoperatively, black patients had a lower risk of undergoing revision (HR = 0.23; 95% CI = 0.08 to 0.63). Conclusions In a large, universally insured ACLR cohort with equal access to care, we observed Asian, Hispanic, and black patients to have a similar or lower risk of undergoing elective revision compared with white patients. These findings emphasize the need for additional investigation into barriers to equal access to care. Because of the sensitivity and complexity of race/ethnicity with surgical outcomes, continued assessment into the reasons for the differences observed, as well as any differences in other clinical outcomes, is warranted.

TI  - Long-Term Outcome of ACL Reconstruction
PY  - 2014
AB  - The occurrence of osteoarthritis (OA) is often thought of as a near-inevitable long-term consequence of ACL injury, with prevalences of 50–80 % reported a decade after the initial trauma [18, 36]. In this view, ACL tears are often quoted as being responsible for a large percentage of the “young patients with old knees,” [18, 37] irrespective of the treatment method. Although surgical ACL reconstruction using tendon grafts has become the current standard of care to treat the functionally unstable ACL-deficient knee [36], controversy remains to exist regarding the effect of ACL reconstruction on the development of knee OA in this generally young population. Current literature contains a number of reports suggesting that the prevalence of OA remains unchanged whether or not the ACL is surgically reconstructed [14, 19], but Daniel et al. [4] even detected an increased incidence of OA in the ACL-reconstructed group. On the other end of the spectrum, some authors seem to maintain excellent results a decade after ACL reconstruction, with reported OA prevalences of 2–3 % [14, 29].

TI  - Rehabilitation After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury: Review of Current Literature and Recommendations.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE OF REVIEW" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is a common surgical procedure with an estimated 120,000 cases performed in the USA each year. Physical therapy plays a critical role in the successful recovery of both surgically and non-surgically managed patients. Interestingly, ACL rehabilitation protocols vary greatly with little consensus among practitioners. Nonetheless, there has been agreement over the last decade to shift from conservative, standardized length protocols to more accelerated, individualized protocols that vary in length and modalities based on patient-specific findings and preferences. This review summarizes the most recent trends, opinions, and modalities in ACL rehabilitation research, with a specific focus on novel methods to treat the specific psychosocial needs of ACL deficient patients.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RECENT FINDINGS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">We found that new protocols emphasize early weight bearing, open kinetic chain (OKC) exercises, and other alternative modalities such as neuromuscular electrical stimulation and blood flow restriction. We also found a recent trend toward the use of clinical milestones to determine when a patient is ready for the next phase of a "step-up" rehabilitation program. One particularly nascent topic of research is the inclusion of methods to treat the psychosocial impacts of ACL injury, recovery, and the anxiety around return to sport. Rehabilitation strategy has become increasingly patient-dependent, and the new modalities being utilized are accelerating patient recovery. Return to sport is a particularly important factor for many ACLR patients, and recovery has an important psychological component that has only recently been addressed in the literature, with positive preliminary findings.</AbstractText>

TI  - A Biomechanical Analysis of Tibial Fixation Methods in Hamstring-Graft Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Background There are conflicting results on the biomechanical properties of tibial fixation devices in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The objective of this study is to compare the initial biomechanical properties of tibial fixation in hamstring-graft ACL reconstruction with interference screw, suspension button, and Tape Locking ScrewTM devices. We hypothesized there are no differences in the initial biomechanical properties of these three tibial fixation techniques. Methods Twenty-one fresh-frozen porcine tibiae were equally divided into three groups of seven tibiae to evaluate the fixation of human hamstring tendon grafts with interference screw, suspension button, or Tape Locking Screw fixation. Using a servohydraulic materials testing system, each graft was subjected to 500 cycles of loading followed by a monotonic failure test. Results Interference screw fixation demonstrated significantly lower cyclic displacement (1.28 ± 0.73 mm) than the other groups fixated with either a suspension button device (2.54 ± 0.27 mm, p = 0.003) or a Tape Locking Screw (2.32 ± 0.42 mm, p = .009), and a significantly greater cyclic stiffness (212.19 ± 40.30 N/mm) than the Tape Locking Screw (137.64 ± 26.17 N/mm, p = 0.002). The interference screw also demonstrated significantly higher pullout stiffness (166.83 ± 23.22 N/mm) than the suspension button (112.78 ± 24.14 N/mm, P = 0.002) and Tape Locking Screw (109.11 ± 12.91 N/mm, P = 0.0002). Conclusions Tibial fixation with an interference screw demonstrated superior biomechanical properties for cyclic testing compared to the suspension button and Tape Locking Screw. Load to failure did not differ between groups, and there were no significant biomechanical differences between the suspension button and Tape Locking Screw fixation devices. Clinical relevance Despite the initial biomechanical differences, all three fixation devices exhibited mean loads to failure and cyclic displacements below clinically relevant thresholds of failure. These data suggest all three fixation methods are viable options for achieving a functional ACL reconstruction.Level of Evidence: V.

TI  - Clinically Assessed Mediolateral Knee Motion: Impact on Gait.
PY  - 2011
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mediolateral knee movement can be assessed visually with clinical tests. A knee-medial-to-foot position is associated with an increased risk of knee injuries and pathologies. However, the implications of such findings on daily tasks are not well understood. The aim of this study was to investigate if a knee-medial-to-foot position assessed during a clinical test was associated with altered hip and knee joint kinematics and knee joint kinetics during gait compared with those with a knee-over-foot position. DESIGN: Participants were visually assessed during a single-limb mini squat test and classified by a physiotherapist as exhibiting either a knee-medial-to-foot or knee-over-foot position. A comparison of 3-dimensional hip and knee gait kinematics and kinetics between the knee-over-foot and knee-medial-to-foot classifications was performed. SETTING: Research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-five healthy participants were recruited and visually assessed as either knee-over-foot (n = 15; 26.2 ± 6.1 years) or knee-medial-to-foot (n = 10; 24.8 ± 4.1 years). INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Peak knee valgus angle and peak internal hip rotation during normal gait. RESULTS: No differences were observed in peak knee valgus angle [3.6 (3.7) vs 5.2 (2.5) degrees; P = 0.19], peak internal hip rotation [8.4 (7.0) vs 4.3 (8.1) degrees; P = 0.21], or knee joint kinetics between groups. CONCLUSIONS: A knee-medial-to-foot position observed during the single-limb mini squat was not reflected during gait measured by 3-dimensional motion analysis in knee healthy individuals. Furthermore, those assessed to have a knee-medial-to-foot position did not display increased loading of the knee joint compared with the knee-over-foot group. Care should be taken when extrapolating results from one movement to another. (Less)

TI  - Radiographic Osteoarthritis Prevalence Over Ten Years After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.
PY  - 2019
AB  - The purpose of this study was to conduct an up-to-date systematic review and meta-analysis of radiographic knee osteoarthritis (OA) over minimal ten years after ACL reconstruction. The database of Pubmed and the Ovid was adopted. The radiographic knee OA over minimal ten years after ACL reconstruction was systematically reviewed. Both the ipsilateral and contralateral knees were evaluated referring to the tibiofemoral joint (TFJ), the patellofemoral joint (PFJ), and the overall knee OA prevalence.

TI  - Does sensorimotor function predict graft rupture, contra-lateral injury or failure to return to sports after ACL reconstruction? A protocol for the STOP Graft Rupture study.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Introduction People with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR) are at high risk of sustaining a graft rupture and/or contra-lateral ACL injury. The main factors that may predispose individuals for subsequent ACL injuries are, however, not established. To reduce the risk of reinjuries, it is of particular interest to identify modifiable risk-factors, for instance, those related to sensorimotor control which are responsive to training. The aim of the current study protocol is to present the design of our prospective cohort study STOP Graft Rupture investigating sensorimotor function as predictors for graft rupture, contra-lateral ACL injury and/or failure to return to sport (RTS) within 3 years following ACLR. Methods and analysis We aim to recruit 200 individuals (15-35 years, ∼50% women) with ACLR from Norrland University Hospital, Umea and Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden. Participants will be assessed with a comprehensive test battery for sensorimotor muscle function, including hop performance, muscle strength, muscle activation, hip and ankle range of motion and postural orientation as well as patient-reported function 1 year after ACLR (baseline). For a subgroup of individuals (Umea cohort), 3D kinematics and joint position sense will also be evaluated. At follow-up (≥3 years post-ACLR), the participants will be asked to answer questions related to new ACL injuries to either knee and about RTS. Separate logistic regression models, adjusting for possible confounders, will be used to evaluate the influence of the different sensorimotor predictors on the prospective outcomes (graft rupture, contra-lateral ACL injury, RTS). Ethics and dissemination This study was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Board (Dnr 2016/319 and Dnr 2019-04037). The results will be published in international peer-reviewed scientific journals and presented at clinical and scientific congresses. Trial registration number NCT04162613. (Less)

TI  - The Military ACL.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in the U.S. Military Service members have a 10-fold higher incidence than that of the general population due to the physically demanding aspects of military duties. Although some controversy exists on the specific techniques or reconstruction, these injuries are uniformly reconstructed due to the requirements of their occupation and the effect of these injuries on their future careers. As such, understanding the care of the military Service member's ACL may help optimize the care of the physically active injured knee.

TI  - ACL Reconstruction: Choosing the Graft.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament is one of the most common ligament injuries in sports traumatology. The need for surgical anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is justified by its anatomical characteristics. Key considerations when choosing a graft include the potential for bone integration and the risk of failure. Bone sclerosis around the tunnel affects the integration of the graft. For this reason, one aspect upon which orthopedic surgeons should focus is the biology of the bone-graft interface. Although the BPTB graft is still used, hamstrings and synthetic grafts have become increasingly widespread and popular over the years. An allograft certainly requires more long-term follow-up to validate its use in response to functional, clinical and biological requirements.

TI  - Evidence of Neuroplasticity and Neuroimaging Techniques following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury
PY  - 2018
AB  - PURPOSE: Recent evidence has linked neural changes in the brain, known as neuroplasticity, to anterior cruciate injury, possibly explaining why some patients suffer repetitive functional instability. Therefore, the purpose of this article was to review the manifestation of central nervous system reorganization following anterior cruciate ligament injury and establish further the application of neuroimaging assessment tools in the evaluation of neuroplasticity after ligamentous injury.
METHODS: Previous research articles emphasizing neuromuscular deficits, functional joint instability, and anterior cruciate ligament injury and neuroimaging techniques searched from PubMed databases were reviewed. Additionally, more relevant research articles through a cited reference search from the original research articles were reviewed.
RESULTS: Diminished neuromuscular control such as proprioception, muscle activation, and joint stiffness regulation appears to be indirect evidence of neural adaptations that may lead to persistent functional joint instability and future pathological complications. Results of direct measurement of the brain’s function using a variety of neuroimaging tools supports altered cortical activation in the brain corresponding to diminished knee function.
CONCLUSIONS: Knee functional deficits after an anterior cruciate ligament injury may be associated with neural adaptations in the brain. Neuroimaging techniques that allow for examination of neural activity in the central nervous system help to better understand the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the link between the brain’s function and functional joint instability, to develop more effective rehabilitation programs, and to improve patient outcomes.

TI  - Quadriceps and hamstring tendon autografts in ACL reconstruction yield comparably good results in a prospective, randomized controlled trial.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Comparable data of functional outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using either hamstring- or quadriceps tendon grafts is controversial. This prospective, randomized controlled trial aims to provide data comparing both grafts regarding the functional outcome. A two centre trial involving symptomatic patients 18 years of age or older with an anterior cruciate ligament tear was conducted. We randomly assigned 27 patients to quadruple hamstring tendon reconstruction and 24 to quadriceps tendon reconstruction. The patients were evaluated preoperatively, at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months post-surgery. The primary outcome parameter was the side-to-side knee laxity measured with an arthrometer. Secondary outcomes included results in the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm Scores and isokinetic testing of strength in knee extension and flexion. Forty-four patients (86%) completed the 2-year follow-up. There was significantly improved knee stability at all time intervals with no difference between the two study groups. The manual side-to-side displacement improved by 4.7 ± 3.0 mm in patients with hamstring tendon reconstruction and 5.5 ± 2.9 mm in patients with quadriceps tendon reconstruction. In addition, muscle strength and outcome scores (IKDC and Lysholm Score) did not show any differences between the hamstring tendon group and the quadriceps tendon group. Patients in the hamstring tendon group returned to their pre-injury activity level after 95.2 ± 45.5 days while patients in the quadriceps tendon group needed 82.1 ± 45.6 days. Quadriceps and hamstring tendon autografts yield comparably good results in primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

TI  - Prediction and prevention of musculoskeletal injury: a paradigm shift in methodology
PY  - 2009
AB  - Traditional methods employed to study musculoskeletal injury mechanisms and joint biomechanics utilise in vivo or in vitro techniques. The advent of new technology and improved methods has also given rise to in silico (computer modelling) techniques. Under the current research paradigm, in vivo, in vitro and in silico methods independently provide information regarding the mechanisms and prevention of musculoskeletal injury. However, individually, each of these methods has multiple, inherent limitations and is likely to provide incomplete answers about multifactorial, complex injury conditions. The purpose of this treatise is to review current methods used to study, understand, and prevent musculoskeletal injury and to develop new conceptual-methodological frameworks that may help create a paradigm shift in musculoskeletal injury prevention research. We term the fusion of these three techniques in simulacra amalgama, or simply in sim, meaning a “union of models done on the likeness of phenomena.” Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury will be employed as a model example for the utility and applicability of the proposed, synthesised approach. Shifting the current experimental paradigm to incorporate a multifaceted, multidisciplinary, integration of in vivo, in vitro and in silico methods into the proposed in sim approaches may provide a platform for a more comprehensive understanding of the relationships between complex joint biomechanics and observed injury mechanisms.

TI  - Factors Related to Return to Sport After ACL Reconstruction: When Is It Safe?
PY  - 2012
AB  - Current clinical practice permits patients to return to sport at between 6 and 12 months postoperatively. There is high-quality evidence to indicate that most patients (93 %) do attempt some form of sport after surgery. However, it appears that, at best, only approximately 60 % return to their pre-injury level of sports participation. There are many factors that may influence when it is safe to return to sport, and many criteria have been used to guide the patient and treating health professional. However, the validity of such criteria remains to be established. Similarly, there may be aspects of graft healing that influence safety in return to sport, but these are yet to be fully explored in vivo. The health of other structures in the knee must also be considered when making return-to-play decisions. The clinician should ask the following: Is it safe for the ACL graft, and is it safe for the health of the whole knee for the patient to return to sport at this time?

TI  - Intraarticular application of autologous conditioned serum (ACS) reduces bone tunnel widening after ACL reconstructive surgery in a randomized controlled trial.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Purpose Pro-inflammatory cytokines play a pivotal role in osteoarthritis, as well as in bone tunnel widening after ACL reconstructive surgery. A new treatment option is to administer autologous conditioned serum (ACS) containing endogenous anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1Ra and growth factors (IGF-1, PDGF, and TGF-b1, among others) in the liquid blood phase. The purpose of this trial was to establish whether the postoperative outcome could be affected by intraarticular application of ACS. Methods In a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial with two parallel groups, 62 patients were treated. Bone tunnel width was measured by CT scans, while clinical efficacy was assessed by patientadministered outcome instruments (WOMAC, IKDC 2000) up to 1 year following the ACL reconstruction in patients receiving either ACS (Group A) or placebo (Group B). We compared the levels and dynamics of IL-1b concentrations in the synovial liquid and examined the correlation between the levels of IL-1b at three different postoperative points. Results Bone tunnel enlargement was significantly less (6 months: 8%, 12 months: 13%) in Group A than in Group B (6 months: 31%, 12 months: 38%). Clinical outcomes (WOMAC, IKDC 2000) were consistently better in patients treated with ACS at all data points and for all outcome parameters, and there were statistically significant differences in the WOMAC stiffness subscale after 1 year. The decrease in IL-1b synovial fluid concentration was more pronounced in the ACS group, and values were lower, to a statistically significant degree, in the ACS group at day 10. Conclusion The intraarticular administration/injection of ACS results in decreased bone tunnel widening after ACL reconstructive surgery. Level of evidence Therapeutic study, Randomized controlled trial (significant differences and narrow confidence intervals), Level I.

TI  - Patellar and hamstring autografts are associated with different jump task loading asymmetries after ACL reconstruction
PY  - 2019
AB  - © 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd After anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), there is a higher re-injury rate to the contralateral limb in athletes who undergo surgery using a bone-patellar-tendon-bone (BPTB) autograft than using a semitendinosus and gracilis hamstring tendon (HT) autograft. This may be influenced by differing lower-limb loading asymmetries present when athletes of each graft type return to play (RTP). The aim of this study was to compare bilateral countermovement jump (CMJ) phase-specific impulse asymmetries between athletes with BPTB and HT autografts 9 months post-ACLR, and to identify the relationship between impulse and isokinetic strength asymmetries. Male field sport athletes with a BPTB (n = 22) or HT (n = 22) autograft were tested approximately 9 months post-ACLR. An uninjured control group (n = 22) was also tested on a single occasion. Phase-specific bilateral absolute impulse asymmetries were calculated during the CMJ and compared between groups using Kruskal-Wallis and post-hoc testing. A linear regression model was used to assess the relationship between impulse asymmetries and isokinetic concentric knee extensor strength asymmetries. BPTB athletes demonstrated greater impulse asymmetries than HT athletes during the eccentric (P = 0.01) and concentric (P = 0.008) phases of the jump. Isokinetic strength asymmetry was a significant predictor of CMJ concentric impulse asymmetry in both BPTB (r2 = 0.39) and HT athletes (r2 = 0.18) but not eccentric impulse asymmetry in any group. The greater loading asymmetries demonstrated by BPTB than HT athletes 9 months after ACLR may contribute to the differing incidence rates of contralateral ACL injury. The findings suggest that graft-specific loading asymmetries should be targeted during rehabilitation prior to RTP.

TI  - Influence of Age on Healing Capacity of Acute Tears of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament Based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging Assessment.
PY  - 2017
AB  - OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of patient age on the effects of conservative treatment of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). METHODS A total of 102 consecutive patients with acute ACL injury were allowed to heal without surgery. Final magnetic resonance imaging images of the ACL were classified from grade I, indicating good morphological recovery, to grade IV, indicating poor recovery. Chi-square analysis was used to determine significant differences in the incidence of grades I and II among those less than 20 versus those 20 years or more of age. RESULTS The mean follow-up to final magnetic resonance imaging was 9 months. A significant difference in the frequency of grades I and II was observed between age groups (<20 years, 13.0%; ≥20 years, 69.6%; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION ACL injury was more severe, and morphological recovery with conservative treatment was poorer among younger patients than among adults.

TI  - Pros and Cons of Different ACL Graft Fixation Devices
PY  - 2017
AB  - Graft fixation is an important component of success (or failure) of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Modern techniques, on the whole, are much stronger than first-generation techniques (such as suture over a post). This is significant as studies have demonstrated the importance of early rehabilitation to limit knee stiffness and prevent the deleterious effects of prolonged immobilization and/or limited weight-bearing for articular cartilage health and knee function. Thus, ACL fixation devices must provide strength and stiffness sufficient for rehabilitation and activities of daily living until biologic fixation has taken place. No ACL graft fixation device is perfect. The surgeon must weigh the pros and cons of the different ACL graft fixation devices before deciding which device to use for a particular patient.

TI  - "Ligamentization" in hamstring tendon grafts after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a systematic review of the literature and a glimpse into the future
PY  - 2013
AB  - Purpose The aims of this study were to provide a systematic review of the literature on "ligamentization" in hamstring tendon (HT) grafts after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and analyze the postoperative remodeling process in human patients and animal models. Methods We performed a search in the Medline, PubMed, Embase and The Cochrane Library databases, followed by a manual search of reference lists to identify relevant articles. Only studies that investigated the ligamentization of hamstring grafts by histologic examination and comprehensively reported on the remodeling process were deemed eligible for review. Results A total of 4 studies were determined appropriate for systematic review: 2 of the included studies investigated human ACL grafts and 2 were performed in animal models. The studies included the examination of 79 human hamstring graft biopsy specimens and grafts of 27 skeletally mature sheep. To verify the remodeling process, authors reported on various aspects of cellularity, vascularity, and collagen organization. None of the included studies reached a level of evidence higher than 3. Conclusions A postoperative ligamentization process can be found in HT grafts after ACL reconstruction and shows a typical progression through 3 distinguishable remodeling phases in humans and in animal models, whereas the progression and intensity of remodeling is distinctly increased in animals. Clinical Relevance Because postoperative remodeling influences biomechanical properties of hamstring grafts, a better understanding of this process and its timing could lead to substantial improvements in postoperative care strategies and indirectly to the optimization of surgical techniques.

TI  - Neuromuscular control in males and females 1 year after an anterior cruciate ligament rupture or reconstruction during stair descent and artificial tibial translation.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Neuromuscular alterations are reported in patients with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R) and conservative treatment (copers with ACL deficiency, ACL-C). However, it is unclear whether sex influences neuromuscular control. The objective was to investigate differences in neuromuscular control regarding sex and treatment type one year after ACL rupture in comparison to a group with an intact ACL (ACL-I). Electromyography of vastus medialis (VM) and lateralis, biceps femoris (BF) and semitendinosus (ST) was recorded in ACL-R (N = 38), ACL-C (N = 26), and ACL-I (N = 38) during stair descent and reflex activity by anterior tibial translation while standing. The movements of stair descent were divided into pre-activity, weight-acceptance and push-off phases, reflex activity in pre-activation, short, medium (MLR), and long latency responses (LLR). Normalized root mean squares for each muscle of involved and matched control limb per phase were calculated and analyzed with two-way ANOVA (α = 0.05). During stair descent, neuromuscular differences of BF were significant during push-off only (p = 0.001). Males of ACL-R and ACL-C had higher BF activity compared to ACL-I (p = 0.009, 0.007 respectively). During reflex activity, VM and BF were significantly different between treatment groups for pre-activation (p = 0.013, 0.035 respectively). VM pre-activation of females was higher in ACL-R compared to ACL-C (p = 0.018), and lower in ACL-C compared to ACL-I (p = 0.034). Males of ACL-R showed higher VM and less BF pre-activation (p = 0.025, p = 0.003 respectively) compared to ACL-I. Males of ACL-C had less BF pre-activation compared to ACL-I (p = 0.019). During MLR, intra-group differences in ST were found for treatment (p = 0.011) and females of ACL-R compared to ACL-I (p = 0.015). During LLR, overall intra-group differences in VM were present for treatment (p = 0.034) and in females (ACL-R versus ACL-C (p = 0.015), ACL-I (p = 0.049), respectively). One year after an ACL rupture, neuromuscular alterations persist regardless of treatment and sex. Standard rehabilitation protocols may not be able to restore neuromuscular control. Future research should include long-term follow up and focus on exercises targeting neuromuscular function.

TI  - Likelihood of ACL graft rupture: not meeting six clinical discharge criteria before return to sport is associated with a four times greater risk of rupture
PY  - 2016
AB  - Background The decision as to whether or not an athlete is ready to return to sport (RTS) after ACL reconstruction is difficult as the commonly used RTS criteria have not been validated.

Purpose To evaluate whether a set of objective discharge criteria, including muscle strength and functional tests, are associated with risk of ACL graft rupture after RTS.

Materials and methods 158 male professional athletes who underwent an ACL reconstruction and returned to their previous professional level of sport were included. Before players returned to sport they underwent a battery of discharge tests (isokinetic strength testing at 60°, 180° and 300°/s, a running t test, single hop, triple hop and triple crossover hop tests). Athletes were monitored for ACL re-ruptures once they returned to sport (median follow-up 646 days, range 1–2060).

Results Of the 158 athletes, 26 (16.5%) sustained an ACL graft rupture an average of 105 days after RTS. Two factors were associated with increased risk of ACL graft rupture: (1) not meeting all six of the discharge criteria before returning to team training (HR 4.1, 95% CI 1.9 to 9.2, p≤0.001); and (2) decreased hamstring to quadriceps ratio of the involved leg at 60°/s (HR 10.6 per 10% difference, 95% CI 10.2 to 11, p=0.005).

Conclusions Athletes who did not meet the discharge criteria before returning to professional sport had a four times greater risk of sustaining an ACL graft rupture compared with those who met all six RTS criteria. In addition, hamstring to quadriceps strength ratio deficits were associated with an increased risk of an ACL graft rupture.

TI  - Morphologic Characteristics and Strength of the Hamstring Muscles Remain Altered at 2 Years After Use of a Hamstring Tendon Graft in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction
PY  - 2016
AB  - Background:The hamstring tendon graft used in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction has been shown to lead to changes to the semitendinosus and gracilis musculature.Hypothesis:We hypothesized that (1) loss of donor muscle size would significantly correlate with knee muscle strength deficits, (2) loss of donor muscle size would be greater for muscles that do not experience tendon regeneration, and (3) morphological adaptations would also be evident in nondonor knee muscles.Study Design:Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.Methods:Twenty participants (14 men and 6 women, mean age 29 ± 7 years, mean body mass 82 ± 15 kg) who had undergone an ACL reconstruction with a hamstring tendon graft at least 2 years previously underwent bilateral magnetic resonance imaging and subsequent strength testing. Muscle and tendon volumes, peak cross-sectional areas (CSAs), and lengths were determined for 12 muscles and 6 functional muscle groups of the surgical and contralateral limbs.

TI  - Comparison of Bone-Patella Tendon-Bone and Four-Strand Hamstring Tendon Grafts for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Prospective Study
PY  - 2021
AB  - Introduction To date, the proper choice of graft for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction remains a matter of conflict. We aimed to compare the clinical and functional outcomes of the two most commonly utilized autografts, bone-patella tendon-bone (BPTB) and four-strand hamstring tendon (HT) graft, at 6 and 12 months after surgery. Methods In a prospective randomized study, we included a total of 60 patients undergoing ACL reconstruction, thirty in BPTB and thirty in HT group. All patients were amateur athletes and were evaluated at 6 and12 months after surgery for: (a)postoperativefunctionality of the operated knee by the Tegner, the Lysholm and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scoring scales, (b) anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) instability of the operated knee compared to the healthy contralateral knee by the KT-1000 arthrometer and (c) theextension and flexion muscle strength of the operated knee by a CYBEXisokinetic dynamometer.<i> </i> Results Patients in the two groups did not differ regarding demographics, and pre-injury functionality status. Significantly more patients in the HT group (n=6) compared to the BPTB group (n=1) experienced ACL re-rupture and underwent revision surgery before follow-up end (p=0.044). All patients, regardless of graft, showed significant improvement within each group of functional assessments by Lysholm, Tegner and IKDC scores, as well as of Cybex measurements -with an increase of peak torque at 60° extension and 180°extension and 60° flexion and 180° flexion- at 12 months compared to 6 months follow-up (p<0.05). However, there was no difference between the two groups regarding knee function improvement or extension measurements neither at 6 nor 12 months. Contrarily, the BPTB graft group had higher values of peak torque (Nm) at 60° and 180° flexion compared to the HT group, both at 6 (p=0.014 and 0.029, respectively) and 12 months (p=0.033 and 0.030, respectively). Postoperative stability was similar between the two groups at 12 months (p=0.519). Conclusion Both BPTB and HT grafts present with benefits and drawbacks and remain viable autograft options for primary ACL reconstruction as each has, although HT grafts seem to be more susceptible to re-rupture. The graft selection should be based on the needs and activities of each patient.

TI  - Trunk Muscle Endurance in Individuals With and Without a History of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is one of the most common knee injuries and often leads to surgery. Second injury after an ACL reconstruction (ACLR) is a major risk after rehabilitation, and may be linked to persistent postoperative deficits in muscular strength and endurance. Trunk muscle endurance has not been well studied after ACLR. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare trunk endurance using the established McGill testing battery in 20 individuals who had previously undergone ACLR at least 1 year before with 20 controls matched for sex frequency, limb dominance, age, body mass index, and activity level. Four static positional holds to failure were performed in random order, with time in seconds recorded as the primary dependent variable. Mann-Whitney U tests using an alpha level of 0.05 were conducted comparing hold times for all positions between groups. Effect sizes were also calculated between groups. Deficits in trunk extension endurance were observed in the surgical group. The results of this study suggest that contemporary rehabilitation schemes after ACLR do not fully address trunk endurance deficits. Health care professionals delivering postoperative rehabilitation after ACLR may consider direct assessment of trunk endurance and targeted exercise training to address potential deficits.

TI  - A Comparative Study of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Versus Conservative Treatment.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Background The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is a common injury with an incidence of 68.6 in 100,000 patients per year. Despite extensive research on ACL rupture, there are insufficient high-quality studies to determine clear treatment strategies for adults lacking the ACL. This study aims to examine the functional differences between surgical and conservative treatment based on the quality of the surgical process. Methodology In this prospective, comparative study, a total of 136 patients aged between 18 and 35 years were enrolled per inclusion and exclusion criteria. Using the lottery system, patients were divided into the following two groups: group A (n = 71) and group B (n = 65). Group A was treated with arthroscopic ACL reconstruction and rehabilitation, whereas group B was treated conservatively (rehabilitation). Patient data, including age, sex, body mass index, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Tegner Activity Level (TAL) score, and complications were recorded and compared. Results The demographic data were comparable, where males had dominancy in both groups. The mean IKDC and KOOS scores were higher in group A at all follow-ups compared to group B. The scores gradually increased at every follow-up till six months. At the final follow-up, the IKDC and KOOS scores were higher in group A than in group B, and a significant difference was observed among both groups. The TAL score also gradually increased at every follow-up till 6 months. At the final follow-up, the TAL score was higher in group A than in group B, with a significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.0032). Complications in both groups were comparable. Conclusions This study showed that both the conservatively treated group and the rebuilt group had identical outcomes, with the exception of the conservative group having greater objectively quantifiable instability. However, at the final follow-up, patients reported feeling just as satisfied with their knee without surgery, demonstrating no subjective difference in activity levels or functional outcomes. Therefore, non-athletes with an ACL-insufficient knee should still choose conservative treatment.

TI  - THE INFLUENCE OF VISUAL FIXATION ON HOP TEST PERFORMANCE.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Background It has been recognized that anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries typically occur when athletes are attending to a secondary task or object, including teammates, opponents, and/or a goal. Commonly applied tests after ACL injury include a series of hop tests to determine functional status, yet do not control for visual fixation. Purpose To examine the influence of visual fixation during two functional hop tests in healthy individuals. Study design Repeated measures. Methods Participants performed the crossover triple hop for distance (XHOP) on the left lower limb, and the medial triple hop for distance (MHOP) on the right. For the hop test only conditions, participants were not instructed where to fix their vision while performing the hop test. The visual fixation condition required participants to fix their vision on an alternating plus/minus sign at the center of a display monitor located in front of the participant while performing each hop test, respectively. A retest session occurred 48-72 hours after the initial test session in order to examine reliability. Results Thirty-four healthy adults (age: 24.0 ± 3.9 years) completed testing procedures, performing the XHOP and MHOP under standard and visual fixation conditions. Of those participants, twelve completed a retest session for reliability analysis. Hop distance was not altered by the addition of visual fixation (p = 0.27), with trivial effect sizes found across conditions (d = 0.02 - 0.07); however, the addition of visual fixation slightly improved within- and between-session intrarater reliability, standard error of measurement, and minimal detectable change of the MHOP. Conclusion Hop distance during the XHOP and MHOP was not influenced by visual fixation. Measurement of both the XHOP and MHOP was reliable, but lacked precision. Measurement properties for the MHOP including within- and between-session reliability, standard error of measurement, and minimal detectable change improved slightly with the addition of visual fixation compared to normal MHOP procedures. Level of evidence 2b.

TI  - THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRE-OPERATIVE AND TWELVE-WEEK POST-OPERATIVE Y-BALANCE AND QUADRICEPS STRENGTH IN ATHLETES WITH AN ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT TEAR.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Background Pre-operative quadriceps strength may have a positive influence on post-operative function and outcomes at time of return to sport. Little consideration has been given to quadriceps strength during the early post-operative timeframes. Twelve-week post-operative anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R) is considered a critical time point for progression in the rehabilitation process. There is currently limited research looking at the relationship between clinical measurements pre-operatively and at 12-weeks following ACL-R. Purpose/Hypothesis The primary purpose of this study was to examine the differences between Y-Balance Test Lower Quarter (YBT-LQ) and isokinetic quadriceps strength tested pre-operatively and post-operatively following ACL-R (12-weeks). Study Design Within subject, repeated measures. Methods Thirty-nine participants (15.6 ± 1.5 y/o) were diagnosed with an ACL tear and were undergoing rehabilitation to return to a sport requiring cutting and pivoting were included. YBT-LQ and isokinetic quadriceps strength were assessed pre-operatively and at 12-weeks after ACL-R. YBT-LQ composite scores were calculated bilaterally and isokinetic quadriceps strength was tested using the Biodex Multi-Joint Testing and Rehabilitation System. Paired T-tests were used to determine mean group differences between YBT-LQ and isokinetic quadriceps strength scores pre-operatively and at 12-weeks post-operative. A Pearson Correlation was performed to determine relationships between variables at both time points. Results There was a significant improvement in YBT-LQ composite scores from pre-operative to 12-weeks post-operative on both the involved (Pre-operative: 89.0 ± 7.7; 12-weeks: 94.1 ± 7.1, p<0.001) and uninvolved (Pre-operative: 92.6 ± 6.2; 12-weeks: 97.6 ± 6.8, p<0.001) limbs. Quadriceps strength decreased significantly from pre-operative to 12-weeks on the involved limb (Pre-operative: 82.3 ftlbs ± 38.6; 12-weeks: 67.9 ftlbs±27.4, p<0.01), but no differences were found on the uninvolved limb (Pre-operative: 117.3ftlbs ± 42.0; 12-weeks: 121.7ftlbs ± 41.5, p = 0.226). Conclusions Involved limb quadriceps strength decreases from time of pre-operative to 12-weeks following ACL-R. Level of Evidence 3.

TI  - Patellar Tendon Versus 4-Strand Semitendinosus and Gracilis Autografts for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials With Mid- to Long-Term Follow-Up
PY  - 2020
AB  - Purpose To compare patellar tendon (PT) autografts with 4-strand semitendinosus and gracilis (STG) autografts concerning knee stability, functional outcomes, as well as complications after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction at minimal follow-up of 5 years. Methods A systematic search of the literature was performed in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to identify published prospective randomized controlled trials on clinical studies comparing PT autograft and 4-strand STG autografts for ACL reconstruction. The results of the eligible studies were analyzed in terms of knee stability (laxity measurements, Lachman test, and pivot-shift test), functional outcomes (Lysholm score, International Knee Documentation Committee score, Cincinnati score, Tegner score, single-legged hop test, and return to preinjury activity level), and complications (loss of range of motion [ROM], pain, graft re-rupture, revision, and osteoarthritis [OA]). Results Nine clinical studies with 630 patients (313 PT and 317 STG autografts) met the inclusion criteria. No statistically significant differences were found between the PT and STG group in Lachman test, pivot-shift test, International Knee Documentation Committee score, Cincinnati score, loss of ROM, kneeling pain, graft re-rupture rate, revision rate, and OA rate. The STG group was found with less anterior knee pain (P = .003). There were no clinically significant differences for the outcomes of SSD, Lysholm score, and Tegner score. Conclusions Except for significantly greater risk of anterior knee pain, PT autograft had comparable results with 4-strand STG autograft in terms of knee stability and functional outcomes after ACL reconstruction with mid- to long-term follow-up. Besides, we found no statistically significant difference in loss of ROM, kneeling pain, graft re-rupture rate, revision rate, and OA change, but these results were underpowered. Level of evidence Level I, meta-analysis of Level I studies.

TI  - Lack of stability at more than 12 months of follow-up after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using all-inside quadruple-stranded semitendinosus graft with adjustable cortical button fixation in both femoral and tibial sides.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Abstract Introduction The use of the semitendinosus tendon alone for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction keeps the gracilis muscle intact and decreases anterior pain in comparison with the use of the patellar tendon. Recently, Lubowitz described a new all-inside technique with an ST4 tendon fixed with a cortical button in both femoral and tibial sides. We hypothesized that this type of graft with cortical button fixation provides well-controlled residual anterior tibial translation ( The aim of this study was to assess the results obtained with this technique in terms of laxity and IKDC score at more than 1 year of follow-up. Material and methods We performed a prospective single-center study to evaluate the results with this procedure with at least 1 year of follow-up. The primary endpoint was the objective IKDC score and side-to-side anterior tibial translation difference. The secondary endpoint was the subjective assessment using the subjective IKDC and Lysholm scores. Tunnel positioning was assessed using the Aglietti criteria. Results Thirty-five patients were included and reviewed with a mean follow-up of 19.7 months. Sixty-three percent of the patients were male and the mean age at the procedure was 28 years. The IKDC score was A or B in 43% of the patients and C or D in 57%; 54% of the patients had a residual side-to-side anterior tibial translation difference less than 3 mm and 29% presented significant pivot shift (grade C or D). Five patients underwent revision surgery, including one for rupture of the ACL reconstruction. The meniscal status did not influence postoperative laxity and the IKDC grade. Discussion Our hypothesis was not verified and the postoperative stability of the knee was insufficient. Postoperative side-to-side anterior tibial translation difference remained greater than 3 mm for 16 patients and the analysis seems to indicate that the distal cortical fixation of the graft with an adjusted loop is insufficient. Level of evidence Prospective study – Level IV.

TI  - Development of a Three-Dimensional (3D) Printed Biodegradable Cage to Convert Morselized Corticocancellous Bone Chips into a Structured Cortical Bone Graft
PY  - 2016
AB  - This study aimed to develop a new biodegradable polymeric cage to convert corticocancellous bone chips into a structured strut graft for treating segmental bone defects. A total of 24 adult New Zealand white rabbits underwent a left femoral segmental bone defect creation. Twelve rabbits in group A underwent three-dimensional (3D) printed cage insertion, corticocancellous chips implantation, and Kirschner-wire (K-wire) fixation, while the other 12 rabbits in group B received bone chips implantation and K-wire fixation only. All rabbits received a one-week activity assessment and the initial image study at postoperative 1 week. The final image study was repeated at postoperative 12 or 24 weeks before the rabbit scarification procedure on schedule. After the animals were sacrificed, both femurs of all the rabbits were prepared for leg length ratios and 3-point bending tests. The rabbits in group A showed an increase of activities during the first week postoperatively and decreased anterior cortical disruptions in the postoperative image assessments. Additionally, higher leg length ratios and 3-point bending strengths demonstrated improved final bony ingrowths within the bone defects for rabbits in group A. In conclusion, through this bone graft converting technique, orthopedic surgeons can treat segmental bone defects by using bone chips but with imitate characters of structured cortical bone graft.

TI  - Effect of open vs. closed kinetic chain exercises in ACL rehabilitation on knee joint pain, laxity, extensor muscles strength, and function: a systematic review with meta-analysis.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText>Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are common among physically active individuals, often requiring ACL reconstruction (ACLR) for recovery. Rehabilitating these injuries involves determining the appropriate timing for initiating open kinetic chain (OKC) exercises. Although OKC exercises are effective post-ACLR, their use in rehabilitation remains a subject of debate. Therefore, this study aims to conduct a systematic review to determine whether OKC or closed kinetic chain (CKC) exercises result in differences in laxity, strength of the knee extensor muscle group, function, and functional performance in ACL rehabilitation. Five electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled between-group trials (RCTs). Two reviewers independently evaluated the risk of bias using the PEDro scale. We performed a meta-analysis using a random-effects model or calculated mean differences (fixed-effect) where appropriate. Certainty of evidence was judged using the GRADE approach. The systematic literature search yielded 480 articles, of which 9 met the inclusion criteria. The evidence for all outcomes ranged from very low to low certainty. Across all comparisons, inconsistent results were found in outcome measures related to knee function between OKC and CKC exercises post-ACLR. A significant increase in quadriceps isokinetic strength was found in post-ACLR and ACL-deficient knees in favor of OKC exercises at 3 (<i>p</i> = 0.03) and 4 (<i>p</i> = 0.008) months, respectively. A significant decrease in knee laxity was observed in ACL-deficient knees in favor of OKC at 10 weeks (<i>p</i> = 0.01), although inconsistency was noted at 4 months. Finally, a significant decrease in pain was found in favor of early OKC compared to late OKC (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.003). Additionally, in ACL-deficient knees, low load resistance training (LLRT) OKC showed no significant laxity difference compared to controls (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). In contrast, high load resistance training (HLRT) OKC had less laxity than controls at 6 weeks (<i>p</i> = 0.02) but not at 12 weeks (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). OKC exercises appear to be superior to CKC for improving quadriceps strength 3-4 months post-injury, whether as a part of conservative or post-surgery rehabilitation. On the other hand, OKC exercises seem to be either superior or equally effective to CKC for improving knee laxity, thus presenting their importance in being included in a rehabilitation protocol from the initial phase.</AbstractText>

TI  - Hamstring harvest results in significantly reduced knee muscular protection during side-step cutting two years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2023
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of donor muscle morphology following tendon harvest in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction on muscular support of the tibiofemoral joint during sidestep cutting. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to measure peak cross-sectional area (CSA) and volume of the semitendinosus (ST) and gracilis (GR) muscles and tendons (bilaterally) in 18 individuals following ACL reconstruction. Participants performed sidestep cutting tasks in a biomechanics laboratory during which lower-limb electromyography, ground reaction loads, whole-body motions were recorded. An EMG driven neuro-musculoskeletal model was subsequently used to determine force from 34 musculotendinous units of the lower limb and the contribution of the ST and GR to muscular support of the tibiofemoral joint based on a normal muscle-tendon model (Standard model). Then, differences in peak CSA and volume between the ipsilateral/contralateral ST and GR were used to adjust their muscle-tendon parameters in the model followed by a recalibration to determine muscle force for 34 musculotendinous units (Adjusted model). The combined contribution of the donor muscles to muscular support about the medial and lateral compartments were reduced by 52% and 42%, respectively, in the adjusted compared to standard model. While the semimembranosus (SM) increased its contribution to muscular stabilisation about the medial and lateral compartment by 23% and 30%, respectively. This computer simulation study demonstrated the muscles harvested for ACL reconstruction reduced their support of the tibiofemoral joint during sidestep cutting, while the SM may have the potential to partially offset these reductions. This suggests donor muscle impairment could be a factor that contributes to ipsilateral re-injury rates to the ACL following return to sport.

TI  - Medial portal drilling: effects on the femoral tunnel aperture morphology during anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2011
AB  - Background: A goal of anatomic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction should be to create a femoral tunnel aperture that resembles the native attachment site in terms of size and orientation. Aperture morphology varies as a function of the drill-bit diameter, the angle in the horizontal plane at which the drilled tunnel intersects the lateral notch wall (transverse drill angle), and the angle of knee flexion in the vertical plane during drilling. Methods: A literature search was conducted to determine population-based dimensions of the femoral ACL footprint. The tunnel aperture length, width, and area associated with the use of different drill-bit diameters and transverse drill angles were calculated. The effect of the knee flexion angle on the orientation (anteroposterior and proximodistal dimension) and size of the femoral tunnel aperture relative to the native femoral insertion of the ACL were calculated with use of geometric mathematical models. Results: The literature search revealed an average femoral insertion site size of 8.9 mm for width, 16.3 mm for length, and 136.0 mm 2 for area. The use of a 9-mm drill bit at a transverse drill angle of 40° resulted in a tunnel aperture area of 99.0 mm 2 and a tunnel aperture length of 14.0 mm. Decreasing the transverse drill angle from 60° to 20° led to an increase of 152.9% in length and of 153.1% in tunnel aperture area. When a 9-mm drill bit and a transverse drill angle of 40° were used, the aperture seemed to best match the native ACL footprint when drilling was performed at a knee flexion angle of 102°; deviations from this angle in either direction resulted in increasing tunnel area mismatch compared with the baseline aperture. Increasing the knee flexion angle to 130° decreased the proximodistal dimension of the aperture by 2.78 mm and increased the anteroposterior distance by 0.65 mm, creating a mismatched area of 13.5%. Conclusions: The drill-bit diameter, transverse drill angle, and knee flexion angle can all affect femoral tunnel aperture morphology in medial portal drilling during ACL reconstruction. The relationship between drilling orientation and aperture morphology is critical knowledge for surgeons performing ACL reconstruction. Clinical Relevance: This study can help the surgeon to understand how drilling parameters affect the morphology of the femoral tunnel aperture during ACL reconstruction.

TI  - The effect of targeted exercise on knee-muscle function in patients with persistent hamstring deficiency following ACL reconstruction – study protocol for a randomized controlled trial
PY  - 2018
AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, using hamstring auto-graft is a common surgical procedure, which often leads to persistent hamstring muscle-strength deficiency and reduced function. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to investigate the effect of a combined, progressive, strength and neuromuscular exercise intervention on knee muscle strength, functional capacity and hamstring muscle-tendon morphology in ACL-reconstructed patients with persistent hamstring muscle-strength deficiency compared with controls. The study is designed as a multicenter, parallel-group RCT with balanced randomization (1:1) and blinded outcome assessments (level of evidence: II) and will be reported in accordance with the CONSORT Statement. Fifty ACL-reconstructed patients (hamstring auto-graft) with persistent limb-to-limb knee-flexor muscle-strength asymmetry at 12–24 months’ post surgery, will be recruited through outpatient clinics and advertisements. Patients will be randomized to a 12-week progressive, strength and neuromuscular exercise group (SNG) with supervised training twice weekly or a control intervention (CON) consisting of a home-based, low-intensity exercise program. Outcome measures include between-group change in maximal isometric knee-flexor strength (primary outcome) and knee-extensor muscle strength, hamstring-to-quadriceps strength ratios of the leg that has been operated on and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) (secondary outcomes). In addition, several explorative outcomes will be investigated: The International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC), the Tegner Activity Score, rate of force development (RFD) for the knee flexors and extensors, tendon regeneration and potential muscle hypertrophy at graft harvest site evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), postural control, kinetic/kinematic gait characteristics and knee-related functional capacity. This RCT is designed to investigate the effect of combined, progressive-resistance and neuromuscular exercises on knee-flexor/extensor strength, in the late rehabilitation phase following ACL reconstruction. Reduced hamstring strength represents a potential risk factor for secondary ACL rupture and accelerated progression of osteoarthritis. If deemed effective, the intervention paradigm introduced in this study may help to improve current treatment strategies in ACL-reconstructed patients.

TI  - Why bone–patella tendon–bone grafts should still be considered the gold standard for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
PY  - 2009
AB  - The patient population that will place the highest demand on the structural integrity and function of an ACL graft, whilst at the same time having the lowest tolerance for any donor site morbidity, is the professional sportsman or woman. The graft most appropriate for this group, regardless of technical difficulties, should therefore be considered the gold standard. We believe that the bone – patella tendon – bone (BPTB) graft best fits these criteria.

Proponents of the hamstring-based reconstruction will often cite the morbidity of the patellar tendon harvest, rather than the merits of the hamstrings, as the principal reason for avoiding the use of BPTB. Concerns exist regarding quadriceps deficit, arthritis, postoperative stiffness, anterior knee pain and sensory disturbance. The complications associated with hamstrings grafts must not be forgotten. These include increased knee laxity, hamstrings deficit and pain, tunnel widening, anterior knee pain and sensory deficit.

### Graft laxity and fixation

The stability of the hamstrings reconstruction when compared with the BPTB graft is frequently questioned. It is a common finding that there is a trend to increased laxity when hamstrings grafts are used.1–3 This has been confirmed in a meta-analysis by Goldblatt et al , who identified a marked reduction in side-to-side laxity difference with the use of the BPTB graft.4 A similar analysis by Forster et al identified a trend to increased chance of a positive pivot jerk in the hamstrings group.5 When laxity is identified in a BPTB graft it is usually associated with tunnel misplacement.6

The cause for the increased laxity with hamstrings has been studied. In 2002 Rittmeister et al analysed the components of postoperative laxity in a cadaveric study.7 They found that the majority of graft slippage occurred at the graft bone interface, with only 8% of elongation being due to plastic …

TI  - Drilling of Bone: Practicality, Limitations and Complications Associated with Surgical Drill-Bits
PY  - 2011
AB  - The drilling of bone is ubiquitous in many fields of surgery including orthopaedics, neurosurgery, plastics and reconstructive, craniomaxillofacial and ear nose and throat (ENT). A cylindrical tunnel is typically prepared in bone using a surgical drill-bit to accommodate a screw or other threaded device for rigid fixation which is provided by the integration of bone (cancellous and/or cortical) with the screw threads. In this configuration bone screws are resistant to axial and shear forces as well as bending moments and therefore suited to the load-bearing function of the skeleton during locomotion. Drill-bits are also used in the preparation of bony tunnels, such as in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Drilling is associated with the conversion of mechanical work energy into thermal energy causing a transient rise in temperature of adjacent bone and soft tissues to above normal physiological levels (Matthews and Hirsch 1972; Lavelle and Wedgwood 1980; Eriksson and Albrektsson 1984; Eriksson, Albrektsson et al. 1984b; Abouzgia and Symington 1996; Natali, Ingle et al. 1996; Toews, Bailey et al. 1999; Bachus, Rondina et al. 2000; Davidson and James 2003; Augustin, Davila et al. 2008; Franssen, van Diest et al. 2008; Bertollo, Milne et al. 2010). Primary sources of this thermal energy are plastic deformation and shear failure of bone and friction at the machining face. The magnitude of this temperature rise is determined by a number of factors, including drill geometry and diameter, rotational speed (rpm), feed-rate (mm.s-1), axial thrust force (N), initial drill-bit temperature and internal or external cooling. The negative effect of elevated temperature on the viability of bone is well-acknowledged and measures to reduce them during surgery are frequently employed, such as manual irrigation with sterile saline (Matthews and Hirsch 1972; Jacob and Berry 1976; Lavelle and Wedgwood 1980; Camargo, Faria et al. 2007; Augustin, Davila et al. 2008). Viability (Eriksson, Albrektsson et al. 1984b) as well as the structure and mechanical properties (Bonfield and Li 1968) of bone are indeed compromised through exposure to elevated temperatures. Another important variable that can influence the biological response for drilled bone is the time which a temperature above a threshold value is maintained. Excessive temperatures and durations at these elevated levels can result in the necrosis (death) of bone, a phenomenon termed osteonecrosis, or the impairment of osteogenic

AB  - The anterior 			cruciate ligament is the most commonly injured ligament within the 			knee and its injury mostly occurs among young and active 			individuals. In the last few decades, the proper kind of graft 			choice that should be used for cruciate ligament reconstruction has 			been controversial. In addition to bone-patellar and tendon-bone 			autografts, many other choices have become popular, such as using 			hamstring tendons and allografts. The aim of this article is to 			evaluate the kinds of choices that are available for grafting and to 			assess their advantages, disadvantages, clinical outcome, donor site 			morbidity, and biomechanical criteria and healing factors. In 			conclusion, t here are certain situations where one graft may be favored over another. However, a universally accepted ideal graft choice currently does not exist. Therefore, a good surgeon should be familiar with the different types of grafting choices. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.4021/jcs 202e

TI  - Correlation between body mass index and quadrupled hamstring tendon autograft size in ACL reconstruction.
PY  - 2017
AB  - PURPOSE the aim of this study was to assess the relationship of patient weight, height and body mass index (BMI) with the size of the quadrupled hamstring tendon used in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. METHODS from patient records, we retrospectively assessed the weight, height, BMI and graft sizes of 126 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using a quadrupled hamstring tendon autograft between January 2010 and January 2013 at our institution. The data obtained from perioperative measurements were studied using correlation analysis. RESULTS statistically significant relationships were found between patient height and graft diameter (p = 0.033, r = 0.19) and between patient weight and graft diameter (p 0.05). CONCLUSIONS patient height and weight were found to be related to quadrupled hamstring graft diameter in our patient population. BMI was not related to the quadrupled hamstring graft size. The exact size of the graft cannot be predicted preoperatively on the basis of these variables. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level IV, retrospective case series.

TI  - Isokinetic muscle strength and readiness to return to sport following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: is there an association? A systematic review and a protocol recommendation.
PY  - 2015
AB  - Introduction Following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), strength is a key variable in regaining full function of the knee. Isokinetic strength is commonly used as part of the return to sport (RTS) criteria. Aim We systematically reviewed the isokinetic strength evaluation protocols that are currently being used following ACLR. A secondary aim was to suggest an isokinetic protocol that could meet RTS criteria. Method Articles were searched using ScienceDirect, PubMed and Sage Journals Online, combined with cross-checked reference lists of the publications. Protocol data and outcome measurements and RTS criteria were extracted from each article included in the review. Results 39 studies met the inclusion criteria and reported their isokinetic strength evaluation protocol following ACLR. The variables that were most commonly used were concentric/concentric mode of contraction (31 studies), angular velocity of 60°/s (29 studies), 3–5 repetitions (24 studies), range of motion of 0–90° (6 studies), and using gravity correction (9 studies). 8 studies reported strength limb symmetry index scores as part of their RTS criteria. Conclusions There was no standardised isokinetic protocol following ACLR; isokinetic strength measures have not been validated as useful predictors of successful RTS. We propose a standard protocol to allow consistency of testing and accurate comparison of future research.

TI  - Revision Risk After Allograft Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Association With Graft Processing Techniques, Patient Characteristics, and Graft Type
PY  - 2015
AB  - Background:Allograft tissue is a common graft choice for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Allograft sterilization methods vary widely across numerous commercial tissue vendors. Multiple studies, despite being limited in sample size, have suggested a higher rate of clinical failure associated with the use of allograft tissue in ACLR when compared with autograft.Purpose:To examine the association of graft processing techniques, patient characteristics, and graft type with risk of revision surgery after allograft ACLR.Study Design:Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.Methods:A retrospective cohort study was conducted that used an integrated United States health care system’s ACLR registry to identify primary unilateral cases in which allografts were used. Aseptic revision was the endpoint of the study. Allograft type, processing methods (irradiation dose, AlloWash, AlloTrue, BioCleanse), and graft donor age were assessed as potential risk factors for revision, with adjustment for patient age, ...

TI  - Press-Fit ACL Reconstruction
PY  - 2017
AB  - ACL graft fixation implants can be associated with complications like divergence, soft tissue irritation, and tunnel widening. Press-fit anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is a novel concept, which was introduced by Peter Hertel in 1987. This idea appealed to other authors who extended its use to different graft types and all arthroscopic techniques. It has the additional advantage of diminished cost, quicker incorporation of graft, and ease of revision surgery. Biomechanical strength testing results have been encouraging, and various authors have presented good to excellent long-term clinical results. In this chapter, we will discuss the history, surgical techniques, biomechanical evidence, and clinical results of press-fit technique.

TI  - Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Patellar Tendon Versus Hamstring Tendon: A Prospective Comparative Study With 9-Year Follow-Up
PY  - 2011
AB  - Purpose To analyze the long-term evaluation of clinical, functional, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results after implant-free press-fit anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with bone–patella tendon (BPT) versus quadrupled hamstring tendon (HT) grafts. Methods Sixty-two ACL-insufficient patients were included in a prospective, randomized study (31 BPT and 31 HT). Both surgical procedures were performed without any implants by a press-fit technique by the senior author. The femoral tunnel was drilled through the anteromedial portal for anatomic placement. At 8.8 years after reconstruction, 53 patients (28 BPT and 25 HT) were examined by different clinical and functional tests. Bilateral MRI scans were performed and interpreted by an independent radiologist. Results On follow-up, the score on the International Knee Documentation Committee evaluation form was significantly better in the HT group. The clinical examination including range of motion, KT-1000 test (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA), and pivot-shift test showed no significant differences. On isokinetic testing, the mean quadriceps strength was close to normal (96%) in both groups, but the hamstring strength was lower in the HT group (100.3%/95.1%). Kneeling (1.5/1.1, P = .002), knee walking (1.72/1.14, P = .002), and single-leg hop test (95.8%/99.1%, P = .057) were better in the HT group. The MRI findings about the mean degree of cartilage lesion (International Cartilage Repair Society protocol) of the operated (2.1/2.1) and nonoperated (1.4/1.8) knee showed no significant differences. No significant difference was found in the grade of medial or lateral meniscal lesion or the number of patients having meniscal lesions when the operated and nonoperated knees were compared. Tunnel measurements, Caton-Deschamps Index, and the sagittal ACL angle were similar. Conclusions The implant-free press-fit technique for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by use of bone–patellar tendon and hamstring grafts with anatomic graft placement is an innovative technique to preserve the cartilage and meniscal status without significant differences between the operated and nonoperated knees in the long term. Significantly less anterior knee pain was noted in the hamstring group, when testing for kneeling and knee walking. Level of Evidence Level II, prospective comparative study.

PY  - 2024
AB  - <b>Objective</b> : Evaluate osteoarthritis incidence in patients that undergone ACL reconstruction using the transtibial technique, with a minimum of 5 years of follow up, with isolated ACL injury. <b>Methods</b> : Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction by the same surgeon using the transtibial technique with hamstrings graft and with a minimum of 5 years of follow-up, without other injuries during the surgical procedure, were selected to undergo imaging exams of the operated knee to assess the incidence of osteoarthritis. The obtained data were evaluated by descriptive statistics. <b>Results</b> : Forty-two patients (44 knees) were evaluated, with a mean age of 31 years old (SD: 8), being 23 right knees and 28 male patients. Mean time from surgery to imaging evaluation was 94.1 months (ranging from 60 to 154 months; SD: 28). Of the evaluated knees, 37 did not have osteoarthritis (83.3%) and 7 had (16.7%). <b>Conclusion</b> : ACL reconstruction with femoral tunnel performed through the transtibial technique in patients without other associated injuries in the operated knee, using hamstrings graft, with a minimum of 5 years of follow up, showed an osteoarthritis incidence of 16.7% in a mean follow-up of 94.1 months.

TI  - The Warrior Athlete Part 2-Return to Duty in the US Military: Advancing ACL Rehabilitation in the Tactical Athlete.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Rehabilitation following an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is a crucial component of the healing and recovery process and full return to duty/play in the tactical modern-day warfighter. The burden of anterior cruciate ligament injuries and subsequent loss of readiness in these military warfighters highlights one of the most significant gaps in musculoskeletal injury care today. Emphasis must be placed on early weight-bearing and range of motion (ROM), namely in this athlete population, to best facilitate a timely care and recovery process. Preoperative rehabilitation should commence immediately following the diagnosis of an anterior cruciate ligament tear, because one of the best predictors of postoperative ROM is preoperative ROM. Recent advances in rehabilitation technology such as Alter-G treadmills, inertial measurement units, and blood flow restriction therapy systems, have demonstrated success in the early rehabilitation of tactical athletes. Alter-G treadmills allow for early weight-bearing with reduced impact and progression in ROM following operative management, while inertial measurement units have been applied to tailoring rehabilitation protocols specifically to an athlete's unique functional deficits. When used in conjunction with a fined tune rehabilitation protocol, implemented by a well versed clinical team, these treatment techniques can greatly expedite the return to duty process and limit long-term complications.

TI  - Evidence-based recommendations for the management of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture
PY  - 2019
AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture occurs most commonly in young and active individuals and can have negative long-term physical and psychological impacts. The diagnosis is made with a combination of patient's history, clinical examination, and, if appropriate, magnetic resonance imaging. The objectives of management are to restore knee function, address psychological barriers to activity participation, prevent further injury and osteoarthritis, and optimize long-term quality of life. The three main treatment options for ACL rupture are (1) rehabilitation as first-line treatment (followed by ACL reconstruction (ACLR) in patients, who develop functional instability), (2) ACLR and post-operative rehabilitation as the first-line treatment, and (3) pre-operative rehabilitation followed by ACLR and post-operative rehabilitation. We provide practical recommendations for informing and discussing management options with patients, and describe patient-related factors associated with a worse ACL-rupture outcome. Finally, we define evidence-based rehabilitation and present phase-specific rehabilitation recommendations and criteria to inform return to sport decisions.

PY  - 2017
AB  - Background:Although knees that have undergone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) often exhibit normal laxity on clinical examination, abnormal kinematic patterns have been observed when the joint is dynamically loaded during whole body activity. This study investigated whether abnormal knee kinematics arise with loading under isolated dynamic movements.Hypothesis:Tibiofemoral and patellofemoral kinematics of ACLR knees will be similar to those of the contralateral uninjured control knee during passive flexion-extension, with bilateral differences emerging when an inertial load is applied.Study Design:Controlled laboratory study.Methods:The bilateral knees of 18 subjects who had undergone unilateral ACLR within the past 4 years were imaged by use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Their knees were cyclically (0.5 Hz) flexed passively.

TI  - Bone Tunnel Drilling
PY  - 2014
AB  - In this chapter, we describe a reproducible, simple to use method that allows correct femoral tunnel placement without the need for aggressive notch debridement. This outside-in technique has a number of advantages over the more conventional in-out femoral tunnel placement via the anteromedial portal. By avoiding the need to place the knee in deep flexion, it allows preservation of the ACL remnant in partial and remnant preserving reconstructions. We propose that this is biologically advantageous. This technique can be applied for single, double-bundle and augmentation procedures.

TI  - KES - An Automatic Segmentation of Bone Tunnels after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in MDCT Image Using K-means Clustering☆
PY  - 2013
AB  - Abstract The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is usually performed for the injured knee. The ACL reconstruction needs two bone tunnels. It is important to measure changing of the bone tunnel regions after surgery. Thus this study aims to propose an automated segmentation about anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral (PL) parts of the bone tunnels after double bundle ACL reconstruction using k-means clustering. Six patients were evaluated (Age 27 ± 7, four males/two females). As a result, this method could be divided for all patients. This study concluded that the proposed method is enough to divide the bone tunnels of double bundle technique after ACL reconstruction.

TI  - Epidemiology of Posttraumatic Osteoarthritis.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Osteoarthritis is a leading cause of disability whose prevalence and incidence continue to increase. History of joint injury represents an important risk factor for posttraumatic osteoarthritis and is a significant contributor to the rapidly growing percentage of the population with osteoarthritis. This review will present the epidemiology associated with posttraumatic osteoarthritis, with particular emphasis on the knee and ankle joints. It is important to understand the effect of posttraumatic osteoarthritis on the population so that sufficient resources can be devoted to countering the disease and promoting optimal long-term health for patients after joint injury.

TI  - Single-Legged Hop Tests as Predictors of Self-Reported Knee Function After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction The Delaware-Oslo ACL Cohort Study
PY  - 2012
AB  - Background:Single-legged hop tests are commonly used functional performance measures that can capture limb asymmetries in patients after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Hop tests hold potential as predictive factors of self-reported knee function in individuals after ACL reconstruction.Hypothesis:Single-legged hop tests conducted preoperatively would not and 6 months after ACL reconstruction would predict self-reported knee function (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] 2000) 1 year after ACL reconstruction.Study Design:Cohort study (prognosis); Level of evidence, 2.Methods:One hundred twenty patients who were treated with ACL reconstruction performed 4 single-legged hop tests preoperatively and 6 months after ACL reconstruction. Self-reported knee function within normal ranges was defined as IKDC 2000 scores greater than or equal to the age- and sex-specific normative 15th percentile score 1 year after surgery.

TI  - Hamstring tendon anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: does gracilis tendon harvest matter?
PY  - 2012
AB  - Purpose
Hamstring tendon grafts are a popular choice for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Typical morbidity reported after hamstring tendon harvest is muscle weakness in flexion, and whilst still a matter for debate, this morbidity may be greater if the gracilis tendon is harvested in addition to the semitendinosus.

This study sought to comprehensively compare the outcome of ACL reconstructions in which the semitendinosus was harvested alone (ST group) or with the gracilis (ST/G group).

TI  - Proprioception After Soft Tissue Regenerative Treatment
PY  - 2017
AB  - Proprioception is defined as the perception of joints and extremities provided by the neural inputs through receptors found in joints and surrounding tissues. In general, proprioception is achieved by afferent stimuli coming from receptors found in joint capsule, muscles, tendons, ligaments, other intra-articular structures, and skin. The important role of the soft tissue is discussed in details in this chapter.

TI  - Arthroscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone
PY  - 2016
AB  - Techniques of reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) of the knee have undergone, in recent years, important changes both in the technical and rehabilitation field, all aimed at a less invasive and better functional recovery for the patient. The appropriate choice of the graft is of focal importance in the success of the procedure, and if only a few years ago the patellar tendon (BPTB) was considered the best choice in ACL reconstruction techniques [1, 2], currently the indications for its use have limited in favour of the hamstring tendons (semitendinosus and gracilis) and to a lesser extent to allografts (especially with regard to the ACL reconstruction revision) [3, 4]. Nevertheless, the patellar tendon still remains today the “golden standard” for the choice of the graft in primary ACL reconstruction particularly in young and active patients.

TI  - Lower Limb Asymmetry After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in Adolescent Athletes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
PY  - 2020
AB  - Objectives

To identify reported (1) common biomechanical asymmetries in the literature after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in adolescents during landing and (2) timescales for asymmetry to persist postsurgery.
Data Sources

We identified sources by searching the CINAHL, PubMed, Scopus, and SPORTDiscus electronic databases using the following search terms: asymmetry OR symmetry AND landing AND biomechanics OR kinematics OR kinetics.
Study Selection

We screened the titles and abstracts of 85 articles using our inclusion criteria. A total of 13 articles were selected for further analysis.
Data Extraction

Three reviewers independently assessed the methodologic quality of each study. We extracted the effect sizes directly from studies or calculated them for biomechanical variables assessing asymmetry between limbs of participants with ACL reconstruction. We conducted meta-analyses on variables that were assessed in multiple studies for both double- and single-limb landings.
Data Synthesis

Asymmetry was more commonly identified in kinetic than kinematic variables. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction appeared to have a large effect on asymmetry between limbs for peak vertical ground reaction force, peak knee-extension moment, and loading rate during double-limb landings, as well as mean knee-extension moment and knee energy absorption during both double- and single-limb landings.
Conclusions

Our findings suggested that return-to-sport criteria after ACL reconstruction should incorporate analysis of the asymmetry in loading experienced by each limb rather than movement patterns alone.

TI  - Validity and inter-rater reliability of medio-lateral knee motion observed during a single-limb mini squat
PY  - 2010
AB  - Muscle function may influence the risk of knee injury and outcomes following injury. Clinical tests, such as a single-limb mini squat, resemble conditions of daily life and are easy to administer. Fewer squats per 30 seconds indicate poorer function. However, the quality of movement, such as the medio-lateral knee motion may also be important. The aim was to validate an observational clinical test of assessing the medio-lateral knee motion, using a three-dimensional (3-D) motion analysis system. In addition, the inter-rater reliability was evaluated. Twenty-five (17 women) non-injured participants (mean age 25.6 years, range 18-37) were included. Visual analysis of the medio-lateral knee motion, scored as knee-over-foot or knee-medial-to-foot by two raters, and 3-D kinematic data were collected simultaneously during a single-limb mini squat. Frontal plane 2-D peak tibial, thigh, and knee varus-valgus angles, and 3-D peak hip internal-external rotation, and knee varus-valgus angles were calculated. Ten subjects were scored as having a knee-medial-to-foot position and 15 subjects a knee-over-foot position assessed by visual inspection. In 2-D, the peak tibial angle (mean 89.0 (SE 0.7) vs mean 86.3 (SE 0.4) degrees, p = 0.001) and peak thigh angle (mean 77.4 (SE 1.0) vs mean 81.2 (SE 0.5) degrees, p = 0.001) with respect to the horizontal, indicated that the knee was more medially placed than the ankle and thigh, respectively. Thus, the knee was in more valgus (mean 11.6 (SE 1.5) vs 5.0 (SE 0.8) degrees, p 0.90 and 96 between raters. Medio-lateral motion of the knee can reliably be assessed during a single-leg mini-squat. The test is valid in 2-D, while the actual movement, in 3-D, is mainly exhibited as increased internal hip rotation. The single-limb mini squat is feasible and easy to administer in the clinical setting and in research to address lower extremity movement quality.

TI  - Transtibial Versus Tibial Inlay Techniques for Posterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Long-term Follow-up Study
PY  - 2014
AB  - Background:The most common technique for posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction is transtibial or tibial inlay. However, few studies have reported long-term outcome comparisons between the 2 techniques.Hypothesis:Tibial inlay PCL reconstruction with patellar tendon autograft will exhibit better clinical and radiographic outcomes than transtibial PCL reconstruction with hamstring autograft.Study Design:Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.Methods:A total of 66 patients (66 knees) treated with PCL reconstruction for chronic injuries constituted the study cohort. Patients were divided into 2 groups: transtibial with hamstring (36 patients) and tibial inlay with patellar tendon (30 patients). The mean time from injury to reconstruction was 12.2 months (range, 2-60 months), and the mean follow-up was 148 months (range, 98-196 months). Outcomes were measured by use of Lysholm knee scores, Tegner activity scores, return to preinjury sports activity, posterior drawer test, laxity test with a Telos device,...

TI  - Considerations for late stage acl rehabilitation and return to sport to limit re-injury risk and maximize athletic performance.
PY  - 2015
AB  - Purpose/Background:
Despite recent advances in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL) surgical techniques, an improved understanding of the ACL’s biomechanical role, and expanding research on optimal rehabilitation practices in ACL‐reconstructed (ACLR) patients, the re‐tear rate remains alarmingly high and athletic performance deficits persist after completion of the rehabilitation course in a large percentage of patients. Significant deficits may persist in strength, muscular activation, power, postural stability, lower extremity mechanics, and psychological preparedness. Many patients may continue to demonstrate altered movement mechanics associated with increased injury risk. The purpose of this clinical commentary and literature review is to provide a summary of current evidence to assist the rehabilitation professional in recognizing, assessing, and addressing factors which may have been previously underappreciated or unrecognized as having significant influence on ACLR rehabilitation outcomes.

TI  - Functional outcome of Arthroscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Hamstring Autograft and Endo button with Supervised Physical therapy Rehabilitation.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Objective: To determine the functional outcome of arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) using hamstring tendon as autograft and endobutton followed by supervised physiotherapy.
Methods: This descriptive study was conducted in AO hospital Karachi from 2nd April 2017 to 2nd December 2020. All patients with Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) tear meeting the inclusion criteria were operated arthroscopically for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) using hamstring tendon as autograft and endobutton followed by 6 weeks supervised physiotherapy. The functional outcome was assessed with knee range of motion, Tegner-Lysholm score and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) at 3rd, 6th and 12th months follow up and compared with pre-operative values. P value was calculated with Chi-square test for statistical significance. P value < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results: The total number of patients in our study were 79. The mean age was 25±3 years (range 18 to 40 years).Full range of knee motion (118±60) was achieved in 75(95%) patients. The mean pre-operative IKDC score of 38.95±5 improved to 67.92±2 at 6th months and to 90.73±7 at 12th months follow up. The mean pre-operative Tegner-Lysholm score of 51(poor) improved to 87(good) at 6th months and 97(excellent) at 12th months. The Lachman’s test and pivot shift test was negative in all patients postoperatively and 56(70.8%) patients could performed single legged hopping test without any difficulty at 6th months post operatively.
Conclusion: Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction (ACLR) using hamstring tendon autograft with endobutton fixation and supervised rehabilitation yielded excellent functional outcomes in majority of our patients. We therefore recommend this protocol as treatment of choice for all patients with ACL tear.

TI  - Principles of brain plasticity in improving sensorimotor function of the knee and leg in healthy subjects: A double-blind randomized exploratory trial
PY  - 2009
AB  - Principles of brain plasticity is used in the treatment of patients with functional limitations to improve sensorimotor function. Training is included in the treatment of knee injury to improve both patient-reported function and sensorimotor function. However, impairment in sensorimotor function often persists despite training. Therefore, it was suggested that training programs need to be more effective to improve sensorimotor function after knee injury. The aim of the current study was to investigate if principles of brain plasticity that have been successfully used on the hand and foot to improve sensorimotor function can be applied on the knee. We hypothesized that temporary anesthesia of the skin area above and below the knee would improve sensorimotor function of the ipsilateral knee and leg. In this first double-blind exploratory study, 28 uninjured subjects (mean age 26 years, range 19–34, 50% women) were randomized to temporary local cutaneous application of anesthetic (EMLA®) (n = 14) or placebo cream (n = 14). Fifty grams of EMLA, or placebo, was applied on the leg 10 cm above and 10 cm below the center of patella, leaving the area around the knee without cream. Measures of sensory function (perception of touch, vibration sense, knee kinesthesia) and motor function (knee muscle strength, hop test) were assessed before and after 90 minutes of treatment with EMLA or placebo. The paired t-test was used for comparisons within groups and the independent t-test for comparisons between groups. The number of subjects needed was determined by an a priori sample size calculation. No statistically significant or clinically relevant differences were seen over time (before vs. after) in the measures of sensory or motor functions in the EMLA group or in the placebo group. There were no differences between the groups due to treatment effect (EMLA vs. placebo). We found no effect of temporary cutaneous anesthesia on sensorimotor function of the ipsilateral knee and leg in uninjured subjects. The principles used in this study remain to be tested in subjects with knee injury.

TI  - Biomechanical asymmetries differ between autograft types during unplanned change of direction after ACL reconstruction.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Nine months after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, athletes who undergo surgery using a bone-patellar-tendon-bone (BPTB) autograft demonstrate higher loading asymmetries during vertical jumping than those with a hamstring tendon (HT) autograft. These asymmetries may transfer into sporting movements with a greater ACL injury risk. The aim of this study was to compare between-limb asymmetries in knee mechanics and task performance during an unplanned 90° change-of-direction (CoD) task in male field sport athletes reconstructed with BPTB or HT autografts. Seventy-eight male multidirectional field sport athletes with either a BPTB (n = 39) or HT (n = 39) autograft completed maximal unplanned CoD trials in a three-dimensional motion capture laboratory at approximately 9 months post-surgery. A mixed-model 2x2 ANOVA (autograft type x limb) was used to compare variables related to ACL injury risk (e.g., internal knee moments) and performance (e.g., completion time) between autografts and limbs. Statistical parametric mapping was used for a waveform comparison throughout stance, supplemented with a discrete point analyses of peak knee moments and performance variables. Interaction effects were found at the knee joint, with BPTB demonstrating greater asymmetries than HT in knee extension moment (p < 0.001); resultant ground reaction force (p < 0.001); peak knee external rotation moment (p = 0.04); and knee adduction (p = 0.05), medial rotation (p < 0.001), and flexion (p < 0.001) angles. No differences were found between autografts for any performance variable. BPTB demonstrated greater lower-limb biomechanical asymmetries than HT during CoD, which may influence knee loading and longer-term outcomes and should thus be targeted during rehabilitation prior to return to play.

TI  - Return to sport following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
PY  - 2012
AB  - Rates of return to pre-injury sport following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction are less than might be expected from standard outcome measures and there appears to be a rapid decline in sporting participation after two to three years. There are many factors that influence whether an individual will return to sport following this type of surgery. They include not only surgical details and rehabilitation, but also social and psychological factors, as well as demographic characteristics. Age is of particular importance with older patients being less likely to resume their pre-injury sport. It is important that future research clearly identify the pre-injury characteristics of the study cohort when investigating return to sport, and also that there is consistent and precise terminology used to report rates of return to sporting activities. Little is known about how to determine when it is safe to return to sport following ACL reconstruction or how to predict whether an athlete will be able to successfully return to sport. Finally, it needs to be recognised that return to sport following ACL reconstruction is associated with a risk of further injury and the development of osteoarthritis.

TI  - THE LARS AUGMENTED 4-TUNNEL HAMSTRING “HYBRID” ACLR GRAFT CONSTRUCTION ALLOWS ACCELERATED REHABILITATION WITHOUT KNEE LAXITY — CASE SERIES OF 111 PATIENTS AFTER 2 YEARS
PY  - 2015
AB  - Purpose: This prospective case series is designed to determine the 2-year clinical and radiological outcomes of patients undergoing an ACL reconstruction using the ligament augmentation reconstruction system (LARS) 133 prosthesis as an augmentation device for a 4-tunnel autologous hamstrings graft, in the context of accelerated rehabilitation. Methods: A total of 91 patients were assessed at 2 years post-operatively after undergoing an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with a doubled semitendinosis and LARS 133 prosthesis for the anteromedial bundle (AMB) and gracilis for the posterolateral bundle. Assessment included clinical review, KT-1000 arthrometry, IKDC, Tegner, Lysholm, Cincinnati and ACL QOL knee scoring, graft failure and re-operation rates. Tunnel positions and synovitis were assessed using gadolinium magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and X-rays. Results: This technique in the context of accelerated rehabilitation is not associated with increased knee laxity and failure. There was no increase in knee laxity, with a mean side-to-side difference in KT-1000 arthrometer testing of 0.5mm (+/− 1.7). Two-year outcomes were satisfactory with 98% of all patients having an IKDC rating of A or B, and mean values of IKDC subjective 86.5 (+/− 11.6), Tegner 6.5 (+/− 2.0), Lysholm 87.1 (+/− 8.9), Cincinnati 378.8 (+/− 41.5) and ACL Quality of Life 81.5 (+/− 19.3). There was no evidence of synovitis and all tunnels were positioned satisfactorily. The graft failure rate was 1.1% and there was a re-operation rate of 15.4%. Conclusion: We conclude that LARS 133 augmentation of autologous hamstrings ACLR provides a graft construct allowing accelerated rehabilitation without increased knee laxity. It is not associated with significant synovitis within the first two years. Re-operation rates however are higher. The rates at which patients recover and return to life and sports activity following different ACLR graft types appears as a topic of future research interest.

TI  - Loss of normal knee motion after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is associated with radiographic arthritic changes after surgery.
PY  - 2011
AB  - Background: Meniscectomy and articular cartilage damage have been found to increase the prevalence of osteoarthritis after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, but the effect of knee range of motion has not been extensively studied.Hypothesis: The prevalence of osteoarthritis as observed on radiographs would be higher in patients who had abnormal knee range of motion compared with patients with normal knee motion, even when grouped for like meniscal or articular cartilage lesions.Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.Methods: We prospectively followed patients at a minimum of 5 years after surgery. The constant goal of rehabilitation was to obtain full knee range of motion as quickly as possible after surgery and maintain it in the long term. Range of motion and radiographs were evaluated at the time of initial return to full activities (early follow-up) and final follow-up according to International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) objective criteria. A patient was considered to have ...

TI  - Myth busters: an AOA symposium: AOA critical issues.
PY  - 2014
AB  - One of the goals of the annual American Orthopaedic Association (AOA) meeting is to address controversy, both in leadership and clinical practice. A panel of experts in their respective fields presented the background and literature behind three "myths" in orthopaedic management and made conclusions as to their validity. First, Dr. Kocher took on the myth of prophylactic pinning on the contralateral "normal" side for a patient with a slipped capital femoral epiphysis. Second, Dr. Probe evaluated the myth that all intertrochanteric fractures are best treated with intramedullary devices. Last, Dr. Foster and Dr. Silvestri tackled the myth that autograft is always the best choice for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. All three of these topics are subjects of current debate. The panel's careful examination of the available data along with their expertise in the management of these problems is presented in this thought-provoking JBJS Critical Issues article.

TI  - Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Injuries
PY  - 2013
AB  - The ACL is composed of two bands, anteromedial band and posterolateral band. Its main function consists on restraint to anterior subluxation of the tibia on the femur. ACL injury is very common, above all in active people. The diagnosis of the injury is based on the physical examination and MRI. Concomitant injuries such as meniscal tears, osteochondral defects, bone bruises and other ligamentous injuries can appear. The option of surgical treatment of the injury depends on the activity level of the patient and the stability of the knee. There are different options in graft selection but patellar tendon graft, bone-tendon-bone (BTB) graft is the gold standard. Hamstring tendon graft, quadriceps tendon graft and allografts are other choices with good outcomes, too. After surgery, bracing has not been shown to have impact on results and strengthening leg muscles takes an important role in postoperative rehabilitation. Infection, deep vein thrombosis, loss of motion, patellofemoral pain, and general pain syndromes are the major complications that can significantly diminish the results of ACL surgery but fortunately, they are very uncommon.

TI  - Osteoarthritis after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: the importance of regaining and maintaining full range of motion.
PY  - 2011
AB  - Context: Several factors have been associated with the development of osteoarthritis after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, yet little attention has been given to the association between range of motion (ROM) and osteoarthritis after ACL reconstruction. Several studies have shown a link between ROM loss and a higher incidence of osteoarthritis.Evidence Acquisition: A search was performed with PubMed (MEDLINE) for English-language level I-IV studies involving the long-term evaluation of ROM and osteoarthritis after ACL reconstruction. Keywords were osteoarthritis, anterior cruciate ligament, and range of motion.Results: Six studies considered whether ROM was a factor in association with osteoarthritis after ACL reconstruction: In 3 of these studies, an association was found between loss of knee motion and the development of osteoarthritis, while the other 3 studies failed to identify a significant association. Two studies identified an association between ROM loss and decreased subjective o...

TI  - All-Inside Quadrupled Semitendinosus Autograft Shows Stability Equivalent to Patellar Tendon Autograft Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: Randomized Controlled Trial in Athletes 24 Years or Younger
PY  - 2020
AB  - Purpose To compare clinical outcomes of knee anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) autograft reconstruction using all-inside quadrupled semitendinosus (AIST) versus bone–patellar tendon–bone (BPTB) in a high-risk athletic population 24 years or younger. Methods Skeletally mature candidates younger than 24 years old with an ACL tear were randomized into either the AIST (n = 32) or BPTB (n = 32) group and were followed for 2 years. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained at 1-year follow-up, and radiographs were obtained at 2-year follow-up. All surgeries were performed by a single surgeon using an anteromedial portal to establish the femoral tunnel. The primary outcome measure was KT-1000 stability testing. Secondary outcome measures included International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Knee Evaluation Form, IKDC Subjective Form, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Marx Activity Scale, visual analog pain scale, and SF-12 (Mental and Physical). Results: At 2-year follow-up, no statistical difference existed with KT-1000-measured side-to-side laxity between AIST (0.3 ± 0.7 mm, 95% confidence interval 0.0-1.0 mm) and BPTB (0.0 ± 0.8 mm, confidence interval CI -0.3 to 1.1 mm) (P = .197). In addition, no statistical differences between the groups were found for IKDC Subjective Form, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Marx, SF-12 Mental, SF-12 Physical, or with regards to imaging findings. Patients with BPTB reported significantly greater postoperative pain scores at days 2 (P = .049), 3 (P = .004), and 7 (P = .015) and had significantly greater kneeling pain at 2 years (P Conclusions ACL reconstruction with an all-inside quadrupled semitendinosus autograft construct is equivalent to patellar BPTB autograft based on KT-1000 stability testing in athletes 24 years or younger. Level of Evidence randomized controlled trial with 92% 2-year follow-up, Level I.

TI  - Outcome After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Revision.
PY  - 2019
AB  - To describe the current literature related to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) revision in terms of surgical aspects, graft choices, concomitant injuries, patient-reported outcome, return to sport, and objective measurement outcome. An ACL rupture is a common knee injury, and the number of primary ACL reconstructions is increasing, implying a subsequent increase of ACL revisions in the future. It is widely accepted that an ACL revision is surgically challenging with a myriad of graft options to choose from. In many cases, simultaneous injuries to the index limb including meniscal and chondral lesions, respectively, are observed in the setting of a secondary ACL injury. Furthermore, the general understanding is that an ACL revision results in inferior outcome compared with a primary ACL reconstruction. Surgical treatment of an ACL revision can be performed as one-stage or two-stage procedure depending on, for example, the presence of limb malalignments, concomitant injuries, and tunnel widening. Nonirradiated allografts and autologous patella tendon, hamstring tendon, and quadriceps tendon are feasible options for ACL revision. Concomitant injuries to the affected knee such as intraarticular chondral lesions are more common in the setting of an ACL revision compared with primary ACL reconstruction while a lower presence of concomitant meniscal pathology is reported at ACL revision. Patients undergoing ACL revision have lower clinical and patient-reported outcome and lower rates of return to sport when compared with primary ACL surgery cases. However, long-term follow-ups with large study cohorts evaluating outcome of ACL revision are limited. Further research is needed to confirm the present findings of this review.

TI  - Achieving More Natural Motion, Stability, and Function with a Dual-Pivot ACL-substituting Total Knee Arthroplasty Design
PY  - 2018
AB  - <jats:p>Reports demonstrate up to 20% of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients are not satisfied and claim their knee does not feel normal. Failure to replicate native anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)-intact knee tibiofemoral kinematics and stability may contribute to this dissatisfaction. Originally described as medial-pivot pattern throughout flexion, recent studies have elucidated the more modern understanding of a complex motion pattern in ACL-intact knees, where walking and early flexion activities near extension exhibit a lateral-pivot pattern and medial-pivot pattern is observed in deeper flexion. A contemporary TKA design (EMPOWR 3-D; DJO Global, Vista, CA) has the potential to promote natural motion and stability by incorporating a conforming spherical lateral compartment to recreate the dual-pivot kinematics. In vivo fluoroscopic studies have confirmed this optimal kinematic pattern of medial-pivot motion during squatting and kneeling activities, with a lateral-pivot motion during walking. Further, near normal knee strength and minimized hamstrings co-contraction provide evidence for optimal intrinsic tibiofemoral stability. Emerging clinical results have been encouraging and support the modern dual-pivot kinematic understanding and in vivo function studies. Recent studies have revealed intraoperative dual-pivot femoral contact patterns optimize patient outcomes. Clinical results comparing the dual-pivot TKA and a traditional TKA design demonstrate patients with the dual-pivot TKA experience a higher level of function and a greater likelihood of a normal feeling knee. Merging the modern understanding of kinematics in ACL-intact knees with a contemporary dual-pivot TKA design may improve outcomes through optimal knee motion and stability, which may narrow the elusive 20% of TKA patients currently not satisfied.</jats:p>

TI  - Comparison of Anteromedial and Transtibial ACL Reconstruction Using Expandable Fixation.
PY  - 2017
AB  - The influence of anatomical or nonanatomical femoral tunnel position on tunnel widening and clinical outcomes in patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is not fully understood. This retrospective study examined the influence of tunnel width and placement on anterior knee stability and clinical outcomes after ACL reconstruction using the AperFix System (Cayenne Medical Inc, Scottsdale, Arizona), a direct expandable fixation technique with autologous hamstring grafts. The records of 80 patients (79 men and 1 woman) who underwent ACL reconstruction were evaluated. In 38 patients, anatomical femoral tunnel placement was performed via an accessory medial portal (anteromedial group); in the remaining 42 patients, the femoral tunnel was positioned nonanatomically using a transtibial technique (transtibial group). Mean follow-up was 40.7 months (range, 27-60 months). Postoperative knee kinetics were measured, and clinical outcomes were assessed using International Knee Documentation Committee, Lysholm, and Tegner scores. Femoral tunnel widening was measured by comparing postoperative radiographs with final follow-up radiographs. Femoral tunnel width was significantly greater (P .05) between the 2 groups. These findings suggest that femoral tunnel widening is associated with increased anterior joint laxity when a direct fixation technique is used for ACL reconstruction, particularly in nonanatomically positioned femoral tunnels. Anatomical femoral tunnel placement provides better anterior stability and less tunnel widening than transtibial tunnel placement; however, these benefits did not produce a detectable advantage in clinical outcomes measures.

Methods: One hundred patients were randomized to have either bioabsorbable or titanium interference screws used for graft tunnel fixation in hamstring autograft ACL reconstruction. Patients were objectively and subjectively assessed preoperatively and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Radiographs at 12 months postoperatively were also assessed for tunnel width. Results: There were no differences in clinical outcome by use of Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee scores between the 2 groups at any stage of follow-up to 2 years. Tibial tunnel widths were the same between the 2 groups. There was slightly more tunnel widening in the femur when bioabsorbable interference screws were used. Conclusions: Identically shaped bioabsorbable interference screws and titanium interference screws used for hamstring autograft ACL reconstruction are equally successful up to 2 years postoperatively. Level of Evidence: Level I, prospective randomized trial with more than 80% follow-up.

TI  - INFLUENCE OF PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS AND GRAFT TYPES ON ACL SECOND INJURY RATES IN IPSILATERAL VERSUS CONTRALATERAL KNEES: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Background There are inconsistencies in the reported rates of second anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries per limb, patients' sex and graft types after primary ACL reconstruction (ACLR). There are also inconsistencies regarding the influence of these factors on the occurrence of second ACL injury after primary ACLR. Purpose To determine the rate of second ACL injury, to either the ipsilateral graft or contralateral healthy ACL, as influenced by sex, age, and graft types and to determine the influence of sex, age, and graft types on the occurrence of second ACL injury after primary ACLR. Study design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods A computerized search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus was conducted using combinations of these terms: ACL, ACLR, re-injury, re-rupture, revisions, contralateral tear, ipsilateral graft tear, and second injury. Articles were required to report the number or percentage of sex, graft type, ipsilateral graft and contralateral ACL injuries after ACLR. Rates of second ACL injuries and pooled dichotomous data were calculated using random-effect proportion meta-analysis. Results The pooled rate of second ACL injuries (ipsilateral graft and contralateral ACL) was 6.11%. A slightly higher rate of ipsilateral graft injuries (3.29%) than contralateral ACL injuries (2.82%) (OR: 1.09 [95%CI: 0.89, 1.34] was reported. Ipsilateral graft injuries occurred earlier (median: 20 months) than contralateral ACL injuries (median: 36.3 months). Men had lower rate of second ACL injuries (5.67%) than women (6.84%) (OR: 0.92 [95%CI: 0.70, 1.20]). Significantly higher rate of ipsilateral graft injuries (3.40%) occurred in men compared to contralateral ACL injuries (2.26%) (OR: 1.53 [95CI%: 1.33, 1.77]), while women had significantly higher rate of contralateral ACL injuries (3.75%) compared to ipsilateral graft injuries (3.09%) (OR: 0.73 [95%CI: 0.55, 0.96]). The rate of second ACL (ipsilateral graft and contralateral ACL) injuries was higher in patients with hamstring tendon (HT) autograft (5.83%) than bone-patella tendon-bone autograft (BPTB) (5.10%) (p = 0.04) and allografts (3.12%) (p<0.0001). The rate of ipsilateral graft injuries was significantly higher than contralateral ACL injuries in all graft types (p<0.001). Conclusion Injuries to the ipsilateral graft are more common than contralateral ACL, with ipsilateral graft injuries occurring nearly 16 months earlier after ACLR. More women sustain second ACL injuries compared to men, with men incurring more injuries to the ipsilateral graft and women to the contralateral ACL. Furthermore, second ACL injuries are more common in patients with HT autograft, BPTB autograft, and then allograft; with ipsilateral graft injuries higher than contralateral ACL injuries regardless of graft types. Levels of Evidence 2a.

PY  - 2016
AB  - Study Design Cross-sectional. Background The association between muscle function and lack of knee confidence in people with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury has not been well investigated. Such knowledge would help in the design of training programs for this population. Objective To investigate associations between self-reported knee confidence and muscle function in patients with ACL injury. Methods Cross-sectional data from 54 patients (mean age, 30 years; range, 20–39 years; 28% women) with ACL injury, treated with training and reconstructive surgery (n = 36) or training only (n = 18), were assessed 3 ± 1 years after injury. Univariate and multivariable ordinal regression analyses were conducted to test the association between the patient's knee confidence (question 3 from the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score as the dependent variable) and performance on tests of muscle power, hop performance, and postural orientation (test for substitution patterns score) as independent variables (a...

TI  - The Use of a Large Animal Model and Robotic Technology to Validate New Biotherapies for ACL Healing
PY  - 2017
AB  - The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is the most frequently injured ligament of the knee. Its surgical management has been using a soft tissue graft as a replacement. The results of ACL reconstruction have been successful for many patients as it can restore joint stability and relieve pain. However, longer term follow up studies have shown unsatisfactory outcomes with as many as 25% of patients having complications that include prevalence of osteoarthritis. With the advances in tissue engineering and regeneration, there is a renewed interest in healing an injured ACL in order to preserve its complex anatomy and proprioceptive responses of the native ACL. Biotherapies including microfracture have been used clinically for healing of an injured ACL. In animal studies, the use of hyaluronic acid, mesenchymal stem cells, platelet-rich plasma, and extracellular matrix bioscaffolds have also resulted in neo-tissue formation to a varying degree. In general, the ACL heal rate is slow and the lack of loading to the healing ACL has deleterious effects on its attachments to bone. Thus, in our research center, mechanical augmentation that could maintain joint stability while simultaneously loading the healing ACL has been used in combination with biological augmentation to incite more robust tissue healing. Using a goat model, the ACL was found to be well healed at 12 weeks. Robotic measurements revealed good stifle joint stability while the tensile strength of the healing ACL was 3 times greater than suture repair and 1.8 times greater than ACL reconstruction. For the future, novel biotherapies, together with precision medicine that is “big data” based, in combination with mechanical augmentation will be explored for human application. In the end, surgeons will be able to tailor biotherapies to heal the ACL on selected patients for more positive outcomes in the long term.

TI  - Functional Outcome in Athletes at Five Years of Arthroscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction
PY  - 2011
AB  - Introduction. The purpose of this study was to analyze the functional outcome in competitive level athletes at 5 years after ACL reconstruction with regard to return to sports and the factors or reasons in those who either stopped sports or showed a fall in their sporting levels. Methods. 48 competitive athletes who had undergone arthroscopic assisted ACL reconstruction with a minimum follow up of at least 5 years were successfully recalled and were analyzed. Results. 22 patients had returned to the preinjury levels of sports and 18 showed a decrease in their sporting levels. Of the 18 patients, 12 referred to fear of reinjuring the same or contra-lateral knee as the prime reason for the same while 6 patients reported persisting knee pain and instability as reasons for a fall in their sporting abilities. The difference in the scores of these groups was statistically significant. 8 patients out of the 48 had left sports completely due to reasons other than sports, even though they had good knee outcome scores. Conclusion. Fear of reinjury and psychosocial issues that are relevant to the social milieu of the athlete are very important and affect the overall results of the surgery with respect to return to sports.

TI  - Osteoarthritis Progression after ACL Reconstruction Was Significantly Higher Than That of the Healthy Contralateral Knees: Long-Term Follow Up Study of Mean 16.4 Years.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">This study aimed to assess long-term progression of osteoarthritis (OA) after isolated anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in athletes compared to the healthy contralateral side.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">The study included 15 patients and 30 knees with a mean age of 40 years (range, 35-46) years, none of whom had had revision surgery or an injury to the contralateral side. The mean follow-up period was 16.4 years (range, 13-22). Clinical and radiographic assessment included the Tegner activity scale (TAS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) grade. The long-term results of the injured knees were compared with the status of the healthy contralateral side and compared with previously published mid-term results of the same cohort of patients.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Patients generally remained clinically asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic at final follow-up, which is reflected by a KOOS pain score of 33 points (maximum 36 points) and an IKDC total subjective score of 87% (maximum 100%). There was a significant difference between mid-term and final follow-up in terms of the function score of the IKDC subjective questionnaire (<i>p</i> = 0.031), compartment findings and donor site morbidity of the IKDC functional examination (both <i>p</i> = 0.034), and the total KOOS score (<i>p</i> = 0.047). The KL score indicated significant progression of OA from mid-term to final follow-up in the injured knees (<i>p</i> = 0.004) and healthy contralateral knees (<i>p</i> = 0.014). Mean OA grades of the injured knees were significantly higher compared with the healthy contralateral side (<i>p</i> = 0.006) at final follow-up, and two patients showed moderate to severe signs of OA in the injured knee.</AbstractText>

TI  - A between sex comparison of anterior-posterior knee laxity after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon or hamstrings autograft: a systematic review.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Anterior-posterior (AP) knee laxity after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction may differ between sexes for different graft types. Females may experience an increase in AP knee laxity following an ACL reconstruction with a hamstrings graft, which is not seen in males with a hamstrings graft or in males or females with a bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) graft. The hypothesis of this review is sex differences in AP knee laxity and this will be identified in patients who undergo an ACL reconstruction with a hamstrings graft, while no sex differences will be observed in patients who have an ACL reconstruction with a BTB graft. A systematic search was performed in PubMed, CINAHL® and SPORTDiscus™. Inclusion criteria were articles published in the English language that studied human subjects who underwent an ACL reconstruction with a BTB or hamstrings autograft, and the presence of a sex comparison on outcome measures including side-to-side difference in AP knee laxity. Methodological quality was assessed using a Modified Coleman Methodology Score. Eleven cohort studies met the inclusion criteria. Six investigated sex differences in both hamstrings and BTB grafts. Three only investigated BTB grafts and two only investigated hamstrings grafts. These studies consistently reported increases in AP knee laxity in females after an ACL reconstruction with a hamstrings graft that was not observed in the other cohorts. This systematic review indicates that female patients have greater AP knee laxity following an ACL reconstruction with a hamstrings autograft compared with males with a similar procedure, and both females and males following an ACL reconstruction with a BTB autograft. These results are derived from lower level evidence, as no randomized control trials have attempted to answer this question. Future studies need to rigorously address this clinical question to confirm the results currently in the literature.

TI  - Reviewtissue engineering of ligament healing
PY  - 2010
AB  - Ligaments and tendons are dense connective tissues that are important in transmitting forces and facilitate joint articulation in the musculoskeletal system. Their injury frequency is high especially for those that are functional important, like the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and medial collateral ligament (MCL) of the knee as well as the glenohumeral ligaments and the rotator cuff tendons of the shoulder. Because the healing responses are different in these ligaments and tendons after injury, the consequences and treatments are tissue- and site-specific. In this review, we will elaborate on the injuries of the knee ligaments as well as using functional tissue engineering (FTE) approaches to improve their healing. Specifically, the ACL of knee has limited capability to heal, and results of non-surgical management of its midsubstance rupture have been poor. Consequently, surgical reconstruction of the ACL is regularly performed to gain knee stability. However, the long-term results are not satisfactory besides the numerous complications accompanied with the surgeries. With the rapid development of FTE, there is a renewed interest in revisiting ACL healing. Approaches such as using growth factors, stem cells and scaffolds have been widely investigated. In this article, the biology of normal and healing ligaments is first reviewed, followed by a discussion on the issues related to the treatment of ACL injuries. Afterwards, current promising FTE methods are presented for the treatment of ligament injuries, including the use of growth factors, gene delivery, and cell therapy with a particular emphasis on the use of ECM bioscaffolds. The challenging areas are listed in the future direction that suggests where collection of energy could be placed in order to restore the injured ligaments and tendons structurally and functionally.

TI  - Reducing the Risk of a Reinjury Following ACL Reconstruction: What Factors Should Be Used to Allow Unrestricted Return to Sports Activities?
PY  - 2012
AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is commonly performed in athletes, with the goal of returning to sports activities. Unfortunately, this operation may fail, and the rates of either reinjuring an ACL-reconstructed knee or sustaining an ACL rupture to the contralateral knee range from 3 to 49 %. A systematic review conducted on 264 studies demonstrated that 105 (40 %) failed to provide any criteria for return to sports following ACL reconstruction. Only 35 studies (13 %) noted objective criteria required for return to athletics. Recommendations are provided for measuring muscle strength, lower limb symmetry and neuromuscular control, and ligament function in patients who wish to return to sports activities. Future studies will determine if demonstration of normal lower limb function before sports are resumed is effective in reducing reinjury rates.

TI  - Analysis of return to competition and repeat rupture for 298 anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions with patellar or hamstring tendon autograft in sportspeople.
PY  - 2010
AB  - Abstract Objectives To establish the influence of the type of surgical technique, competitive level, type of sport and the time before returning to competition on the reinjury rate after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) surgery. Methods The authors followed-up 540 competitive sportspeople who had undergone ACL surgery via patellar or hamstring tendon autograft (HTA) techniques in 2003 and 2004. The sportspeople (all of whom had competed at a regional or higher level) were asked to fill out a questionnaire during their fourth postoperative year. Results The 298 respondees (reply rate: 55.1%) had the same characteristics as the initial (operated) population. The reinjury rates after HTA and patellar tendon autograft (PTA) were 12.7 and 6.1%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between these two values (P = 0.14). Age and gender were not correlated with the frequency of reinjury. The reinjury rate rose slightly with increasing competitive level (regional level: 8.1%; national level: 10.4%; international level: 12.5%) but these differences were not statistically significant. Soccer had the highest reinjury rate (20.8%). Regardless of the surgical technique, sportspeople returning to competition within seven months of surgery had a greater risk of reinjury than those returning after this time point (15.3 versus 5.2%, P = 0.014). The risk dropped from 13.9 to 2.6% (P = 0.047) for PTA and from 16.6 to 7.6% (P = 0.2) for HTA. Of the four reinjuries in sportspeople returning to competition with the first six months postoperative, three occurred within one month of resumption. Conclusion Post-HTA reinjury rates are higher than post-PTA rates but the difference is not statistically significant. For sportspeople at a regional or higher level, the time interval before the return to competition has an influence on the risk of reinjury.

TI  - Quadriceps tendon autograft for primary ACL reconstruction: a Bayesian network meta-analysis
PY  - 2020
AB  - The purpose of the current study was to clarify the role of the quadriceps tendon (QT) autograft for primary ACL reconstruction. Thus, a Bayesian network meta-analysis comparing patients undergoing a primary ACL reconstruction with QT versus patellar tendon (PT) and hamstring tendon (HT) autografts was conducted. This Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted according to the PRISMA extension statement for reporting systematic reviews incorporating network meta-analyses of health care interventions. In January 2020, the main databases were accessed. Articles comparing the outcomes of the QT autograft versus HT autograft and/or PT autograft for primary ACL reconstruction were included in the present study. The statistical analysis was performed with STATA Software/MP, through a Bayesian hierarchical random-effect model analysis. Data from a total of 2603 knees were analysed. The overall mean follow-up was 35.0 months. Among the different grafts were evidenced comparable values of IKDC, Tegner and Lysholm score. The QT autograft detected comparable rate of Lachman test > 3 mm, Pivot shift test > 3 m and instrumental laxity > 3 mm. The QT autograft showed a lower rate of autograft failure above all. The QT autograft detected the reduced rate of AKP than the PT. Quadriceps tendon autograft may represent a feasible option for primary ACL reconstruction. These results must be interpret within the limitations of the present network meta-anlaysis.

TI  - Failure in ACL reconstruction: Etiology, treatment, and results
PY  - 2012
AB  - Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is an increasingly common surgical procedure. Th is trend is likely to continue as the popularity of high-risk leisure activities increases and the rising number of female participants results in greater numbers of ACL injuries. The high success rate of surgical intervention (>90% in some studies (1,2)) combined with a reluctance from the patient to modify or reduce activity even into middle age means conservative treatment is often rejected. In the USA there are >100,000 ACL reconstructions performed each year (3). In the United Kingdom the prevalence is estimated at 5000 per annum (4). Currently between 3000 and 10,000 USA residents and approximately 1000 UK patients are estimated to be candidates for revision ACL reconstruction annually (4).

TI  - The effects of hamstring harvesting on outcomes in anterior cruciate ligament-reconstructed patients: a comparative study between hamstring-harvested and -unharvested patients
PY  - 2011
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of hamstring harvesting in patients after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction by comparing groups with and without hamstring harvesting. Methods We evaluated the effect of hamstring harvesting in 73 consecutive patients who underwent ACL reconstruction: 39 patients whose hamstrings were harvested for autografts (group H) were compared with 34 patients who received allografts during the same time period (group C [control]). The cases and controls were compared by analyzing the following variables: age, height, weight, mean follow-up period, type of tissue used, and meniscal surgery. Outcomes were assessed by the Lysholm knee score, Tegner activity score, and KT-2000 side-to-side difference (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA), as well as functional performance tests. The flexor deficit and isokinetic peak torque for knee flexion were measured in the sitting position (0° to 90°), and the flexion torque at 90° was measured in the prone position (60° to 120°). Results Although significant knee flexion weakness after ACL reconstruction was observed, a significantly greater knee flexor deficit was found in autograft patients than in allograft patients ( P P P P = .002). Conclusions These results indicate significant knee flexion weakness compared with the unaffected knee after ACL reconstruction regardless of hamstring harvesting. Moreover, the greater increase in knee flexor deficit in the hamstring-harvested group compared with the allograft group was statistically significant. However, clinical and functional outcomes were similar between the groups. Level of Evidence Level III, case-control study.

TI  - Focal Cartilage Defects in the Knee Impair Quality of Life as Much as Severe Osteoarthritis A Comparison of Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score in 4 Patient Categories Scheduled for Knee Surgery
PY  - 2009
AB  - BackgroundPatients with focal cartilage defects in the knee may suffer from both pain and functional impairment. Treatment options are often insufficient. It is not known, however, to what extent their complaints affect quality of life, compared with other knee disorders. Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) is a validated global knee score suitable for comparison of patients with knee complaints attributable to different causes.HypothesisComplaints because of localized cartilage defects in the knee reduce quality of life measured by KOOS to a different extent than those due to anterior cruciate ligament deficiency and osteoarthritis, when comparing patients within the working population scheduled for surgery.Study DesignCross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.MethodsPreviously registered KOOS baseline data on patients enrolled in different knee treatment studies were included in the present study; the patients were 18 to 67 years of age (working population) at data registration.

TI  - Factors that Predicts the Size of Autologous Hamstring Tendon Graft for Double-Bundle ACL Reconstruction
PY  - 2020
AB  - To evaluate the effectiveness of demographic data and radiographic measurements for predicting the diameter and length of autologous semitendinosus (ST) and gracilis (GR) graft. Fifty-four cases were included to measure the size of 3 or 4 strands of ST and GR tendons retrospectively. The hamstring length on radiograph was defined as the length from the lowest point of ischial tuberosity to intercondylar notch of the femur. The linear and logistic regression analysis was used to assess the roles of the predictor variables, as demographic and radiologic data, in the outcome variables, as diameter of tendon grafts. The cross-validation with hold-out samples and concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) were also calculated. The hamstring and leg length measurement and gender were associated with the diameter of 4-stranded ST tendon graft. The hamstring length measurement, age and BMI were the factors associated with the diameter of 3-stranded ST tendon graft. The hamstring length measurement was found as a common factor for predicting diameters of hamstring tendon with reliable predictability. Moreover, the equation of multivariate regression analysis for the diameter of 4-stranded ST tendon graft showed the most validated power of prediction. All of the cross-validated R2 values were calculated as similar results of multivariate model, but CCC between the measured diameter and estimated value on the predictive equation showed moderate agreement only (CCC = 0.694). Combining radiographic length measurements with demographic data showed reliable prediction in identifying the risk of inappropriate graft diameters. Level IV retrospective cohort study.

AB  - Background:The risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is 2 to 10 times greater in women than men. While the effect of sex on injury risk is well established, its effects on surgical outcomes remain controversial.Purpose/Hypothesis:To investigate whether the biomechanical outcomes of ACL reconstruction are affected by sex using an established porcine model that displays similar sex-specific differences in knee anatomy and ligament structural properties to humans. The hypothesis was that there will be sex differences in ACL reconstruction outcomes with regard to the graft structural properties, knee laxity, and cartilage damage.Study Design:Controlled laboratory study.Methods:A total of 41 adolescent Yucatan minipigs (23 male, 18 female) underwent unilateral ACL transection and ACL reconstruction using sex-matched bone–patellar tendon–bone allografts (with or without additional bioenhancement).

AB  - Background:The effect of low-dose gamma irradiation on healing of soft tissue allografts remains largely unknown.Hypothesis:The authors hypothesized that soft tissue allograft healing to bone would be delayed compared with that of autograft tissue and that low-dose (1.2 Mrad) gamma irradiation would not affect the healing response of allograft tissue after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.Study Design:Controlled laboratory study.Methods:Forty-eight New Zealand White rabbits underwent bilateral ACL reconstructions with semitendinosus tendon graft. Sixteen rabbits were reconstructed with autografts and the remainder with allografts. The 32 allograft rabbits each received 1 irradiated allograft (1.2 Mrad), with the contralateral leg receiving a nonirradiated allograft.

TI  - Rekonstruktion des vorderen Kreuzbandes
PY  - 2009
AB  - Die Ruptur des vorderen Kreuzbandes (VKB) ist eine haufige und schwerwiegende Verletzung und stellt – operativ versorgt oder nicht – eine praarthrotische Deformitat dar. Die operative Versorgung sollte bei sportlich aktiven Patienten mit einer Instabilitat zeitnah erfolgen. Die am haufigsten verwendeten Transplantate sind Hamstring-Sehnen und das mittlere Patellarsehnendrittel. Mit beiden Transplantaten konnen gute Ergebnisse erzielt werden, wobei die Hamstring-Transplantate eine geringere Entnahmemorbiditat aufweisen. Die Standardoperationstechnik ist die 1-Bundel-Rekonstruktion mit anatomischer Platzierung der Bohrkanale. Der femorale Bohrkanal sollte uber das anteromediale Portal angelegt werden, um eine entsprechend weit laterale Platzierung zu ermoglichen. Die Fixation sollte gelenknah ohne Schadigung des Transplantats erfolgen. Um eine hohe Primarstabilitat zu erzielen, erscheint bei Hamstring-Transplantaten die Hybridfixation am gunstigsten.

TI  - Contralateral anterior cruciate ligament injury after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a case controlled study
PY  - 2012
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this present study was to examine contralateral ACL injury cases after ACL reconstruction, to determine the characteristics of such injuries. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 24 patients with contralateral ACL injury after ACL reconstruction. The control group consisted of 200 cases with unilateral ACL injury. The following were examined in the contralateral group: timing of the contralateral ACL injury, and the situations of the initial and contralateral ACL injuries. The following items were compared between the contralateral and control groups: age at the time of initial injury, level of competitive sports using Tegner activity scores, knee anterior laxity (KT-1000), and the ratio (%) of affected to unaffected legs in the strengths of the knee extensor and flexor muscles 6 months after surgery. Results: Examination of injury situations showed that approximately 70% of the contralateral group was injured in situations similar to those at their initial injuries. There were no significant differences between the two groups in age at the time of initial injury , Tegner activity scores, knee anterior laxity, and the strengths of the knee extensor, flexor muscles and H/Q ratio 6 months after reconstruction. But, the age at the time of initial injury trended to be low in contralateral group. Conclusions: Knee anterior laxity and muscle weakness of the reconstructed legs six months following surgery were not individually related to contralateral ACL injury occurring approximately two years after surgery.

TI  - Outcome of cartilage at 12 years of follow-up after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
PY  - 2016
AB  - Abstract Introduction In cases of chronic anterior laxity, reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) can slow the development of osteoarthritis. This study was conducted to determine the overall prevalence of osteoarthritis and to identify the risk factors after ACL reconstruction. Hypothesis Meniscus tears, time from injury to surgery, body mass index (BMI), residual laxity, and cartilage lesions influence the progression towards osteoarthritis. Materials and methods This multicenter, retrospective study on the outcome of cruciate ligaments at 12 years of follow-up was conducted within the 2014 SOFCOT Symposium. The cohort included 675 arthroscopic reconstructions of the ACL from January 2002 to December 2003. The clinical evaluation included the objective and subjective IKDC score. Osteoarthritis was analyzed on 589 knee X-rays according to the IKDC classification. The predictive factors of osteoarthritis development studied were age, gender, BMI, time from injury to surgery, activity level, medial or lateral meniscectomy, type of graft, medial or lateral chondropathy, tunnel positioning, and residual laxity. Univariate and multivariate analyses with logistic regression were performed. Results The mean follow-up was 11.9 ± 0.8 years. The subjective IKDC score was 83.7 ± 13. At 12 years, the rate of moderate to severe osteoarthritis l (IKDC C or D) was 19% (16% medial tibiofemoral osteoarthritis, 4% lateral tibiofemoral osteoarthritis, and 2% patellofemoral osteoarthritis). The prognostic factors were age at surgery greater than 34 years ( P P P P Conclusions This large-scale study identified risk factors for osteoarthritis that should improve the information provided to patients on long-term progression after ACL reconstruction. Level of evidence Retrospective cohort study, level IV.

TI  - Prediction of Kinematic and Kinetic Performance in a Drop Vertical Jump with Individual Anthropometric Factors in Adolescent Female Athletes: Implications for Cadaveric Investigations
PY  - 2014
AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament injuries are common, expensive to repair, and often debilitate athletic careers. Robotic manipulators have evaluated knee ligament biomechanics in cadaveric specimens, but face limitations such as accounting for variation in bony geometry between specimens that may influence dynamic motion pathways. This study examined individual anthropometric measures for significant linear relationships with in vivo kinematic and kinetic performance and determined their implications for robotic studies. Anthropometrics and 3D motion during a 31 cm drop vertical jump task were collected in high school female basketball players. Anthropometric measures demonstrated differential statistical significance in linear regression models relative to kinematic variables (p-range 0.20) relative to peak flexion moment, peak adduction moment, flexion moment range, abduction moment range, and internal rotation moment range. The current findings indicate that anthropometric measures are less associated with kinematics than with kinetics. Relative to the robotic manipulation of cadaveric limbs, the results do not support the need to normalize kinematic rotations relative to specimen dimensions.

TI  - Anteromedial portal versus transtibial drilling techniques in ACL reconstruction: a blinded cross-sectional study at two- to five-year follow-up
PY  - 2010
AB  - Drilling of the femoral tunnel with the transtibial (TT) technique is widely used in bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Recent studies suggest higher knee stability with the use of the anteromedial portal (AMP). The purpose of this study was to compare functional and clinical outcomes of BPTB ACL reconstruction using the TT or the AMP technique for drilling the femoral tunnel. All ACL reconstructions between January 2003 and April 2006 were approached for eligibility. Forty-seven patients met inclusion criteria (21 TT group and 26 AMP group). Blinded assessments of IKDC score, knee stability and range of motion, one-leg hop test, mid-quadriceps circumference, VAS for satisfaction with surgery, Lysholm and Tegner scores, and SF-12 questionnaire were obtained for both groups. Data on preoperative and postoperative surgical timing were retrospectively reviewed through the charts. The AMP group demonstrated a significantly lower recovery time from surgery to walking without crutches (p < 0.01), to return to normal life (p < 0.03), to return jogging (p < 0.03), to return training (p < 0.03), and to return to play (p < 0.03). Knee stability values measured with KT-1000, Lachman test, pivot-shift sign, and objective IKDC score assessments were significantly better for the AMP compared to TT group (p < 0.002, p < 0.03, p < 0.02, p < 0.015, respectively). No differences were found for VAS for satisfaction with surgery, Lysholm, Tegner, and SF-12 between both groups. The use of the AMP technique significantly improved the anterior-posterior and rotational knee stability, IKDC scores, and recovery time from surgery compared to the TT technique.

TI  - Visual Perturbation to Enhance Return to Sport Rehabilitation after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury: A Clinical Commentary.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are common traumatic knee injuries causing joint instability, quadriceps muscle weakness and impaired motor coordination. The neuromuscular consequences of injury are not limited to the joint and surrounding musculature, but may modulate central nervous system reorganization. Neuroimaging data suggest patients with ACL injuries may require greater levels of visual-motor and neurocognitive processing activity to sustain lower limb control relative to healthy matched counterparts. Therapy currently fails to adequately address these nuanced consequences of ACL injury, which likely contributes to impaired neuromuscular control when visually or cognitively challenged and high rates of re-injury. This gap in rehabilitation may be filled by visual perturbation training, which may reweight sensory neural processing toward proprioception and reduce the dependency on vision to perform lower extremity motor tasks and/or increase visuomotor processing efficiency. This clinical commentary details a novel approach to supplement the current standard of care for ACL injury by incorporating stroboscopic glasses with key motor learning principles customized to target visual and cognitive dependence for motor control after ACL injury.

A four-strand bovine tendon graft was prepared using the following graft preparation techniques: standard graft using the baseball stitch technique (M-tech group); continuous loop graft using the GraftLinkTM technique (Arthrex-tech group); continuous loop graft using the Kessler anastomosis technique (Kessler-tech group); and continuous loop graft using a Double-Z anastomosis technique (Double Z-tech group). Each group of eight specimens underwent cyclic loading followed by a load-to-failure test. The M–technique yielded a smaller graft diameter (8.4 ± 0.5 mm) compared to the statistically equivalent diameters of the three continuous loop techniques (8.9 ± 0.6 mm of Arthrex-tech group, 9.1 ± 0.4 mm of Kessler-tech group and 9.2 ± 0.6 mm of Double Z-Tech group). The continuous loop grafts formed by the Double Z-Technique showed outstanding performance among the tested techniques in terms of ultimate failure load (982 ± 121 N) and cyclic elongation (3.7 ± 1.0 mm). There was no significant difference between the four groups in cyclic stiffness. Of the assessed techniques, the Arthrex technique resulted in the lowest ultimate elongation (2.0 ± 0.7 mm), followed by the Double Z-tech (4.5 ± 1.8 mm), the M-tech (5.2 ± 3.9 mm), and the Kessler-tech (5.3 ± 2.4 mm). The Arthrex-tech group (5.98 ± 0.38 min) displayed the shortest graft preparation time, followed by the M-Tech (7.94 ± 0.58 min), Kessler-tech (9.03 ± 0.39 min) and Double Z-Tech (13.29 ± 1.14 min). Double Z-Tech can improve the construct of continuous loop tendon graft with regard to mechanical performance.

TI  - Rate of force development as an adjunctive outcome measure for return-to-sport decisions after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
PY  - 2012
AB  - Study Design Descriptive, prospective, longitudinal single-cohort study. Objective To investigate the rate of force development to 30% (RFD30), 50% (RFD50), and 90% (RFD90) of maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) as an adjunct outcome measure for determining readiness for return to sport following an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Background One criterion of full recovery following an ACL reconstruction is the ability to achieve 85% or 90% of the maximal strength of the contralateral limb. However, the time required to develop muscular strength in many types of daily and sports activities is considerably shorter than that required to achieve maximal strength. Therefore, in addition to maximal strength, neuromuscular functions such as RFD should also be considered in the definition of recovery. Methods Forty-five male professional soccer players who underwent an ACL reconstruction were recruited. Assessment with the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Kn...

TI  - Rotational Stability of the Knee in a Comparative Study of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using the Double-Bundle and Single-Bundle Techniques.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="Background" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The purpsose of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical outcomes of patients who underwent ACL reconstruction either with the DB or SB technique. We hypothesized that the DB technique would provide better rotation control of the knee following ACL reconstruction.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The study included seventy-five participants (26 DB, 22 SB, and 27 healthy volunteers). Only cases with at least one year of postoperative follow-up were included. The participants performed three different demand tasks: walk task, walk and change direction, and stair descent and change direction, which was tracked using a three-dimensional 4-camera optoelectronic system. The following kinematic data were analyzed: tibial rotation amplitude and maximal internal and external rotation. Knees with ACL reconstruction were compared to contralateral knees with intact ACL and healthy knees. Clinical outcomes were determined using the subjective and objective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) questionnaire and a manual arthrometer (KT 1000).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Both surgical groups exhibited similar clinical outcomes (mean subjective IKDC 91 SB vs. 90 DB, <i>P=0.815</i>; KT 1000 difference: 2mm in both groups, <i>P=0.772</i>). The vertical component of the ground force reaction revealed no differences between the surgical and control groups (<i>P&gt;0.05</i>). Tibial rotation amplitude and maximal internal and external rotation were similar between the control, SB, and DB groups in all three different demand tasks (<i>P&gt;0.05</i>).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Conclusion" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">ACL reconstruction using either the SB or DB technique can restore rotational control to the level of a healthy knee. No clinical or functional differences were found between the SB and DB surgical options.</AbstractText>

TI  - Risk Factors for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury A Review of the Literature — Part 1: Neuromuscular and Anatomic Risk
PY  - 2011
AB  - Context: Injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) of the knee are immediately debilitating and can cause long-term consequences, including the early onset of osteoarthritis. It is important to have a comprehensive understanding of all possible risk factors for ACL injury to identify individuals who are at risk for future injuries and to provide an appropriate level of counseling and programs for prevention.Objective: This review, part 1 of a 2-part series, highlights what is known and still unknown regarding anatomic and neuromuscular risk factors for injury to the ACL from the current peer-reviewed literature.Data Sources: Studies were identified from MEDLINE (1951–March 2011) using the MeSH terms anterior cruciate ligament, knee injury, and risk factors. The bibliographies of relevant articles and reviews were cross-referenced to complete the search.Study Selection: Prognostic studies that utilized the case-control and prospective cohort study designs to evaluate risk factors for ACL injury were included in this review.Results: A total of 50 case-control and prospective cohort articles were included in the review, and 30 of these studies focused on neuromuscular and anatomic risk factors.Conclusions: Several anatomic and neuromuscular risk factors are associated with increased risk of suffering ACL injury—such as female sex and specific measures of bony geometry of the knee joint, including decreased intercondylar femoral notch size, decreased depth of concavity of the medial tibial plateau, increased slope of the tibial plateaus, and increased anterior-posterior knee laxity. These risk factors most likely act in combination to influence the risk of ACL injury; however, multivariate risk models that consider all the aforementioned risk factors in combination have not been established to explore this interaction.

TI  - Assessment of Risk Factors for Failure of ACLR: When to Address Concomitant Pathology
PY  - 2021
AB  - Revision surgery is a known complication after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Identifying the risk factors for graft failure is mandatory, especially if concomitant pathologies are present at the time of the first reconstruction. Biomechanical factors along with associated meniscal, chondral, and multi-ligament injuries may contribute to ACLR failure. Checking these pathologies, evaluating their relationship to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, and knowing their impact on the postoperative outcome may improve surgical approach and more favorable results.

TI  - Patient Preferences for Graft Selection in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="Background" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Selecting an appropriate graft for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction requires consideration of a patient's preferences, goals, age, and physical demands alongside the risks and benefits of each graft choice.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Purpose" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">To determine the most popular ACL reconstruction grafts among patients and the most important factors influencing their decisions.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Study Design" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Patients undergoing ACL reconstruction between October 2022 and April 2023 completed a survey either before (nonconsult group) or after (consult group) speaking with their surgeon, who provided an evidence-based description of the pros and cons of an allograft and the following autografts: bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB), hamstring tendon (HT), and quadriceps tendon (QT). Patient characteristics, graft choice, information influencing their graft choice, and surgeon recommendation were collected and compared between the groups.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Among the 100 included patients, 59.0% were male, and the mean age was 28.3 ± 10.4 years. The most popular grafts were the BPTB (56.0%), followed by the QT (29.0%), HT (8.0%), and allograft (7.0%). No significant difference was observed in the graft selection between the consult group (n = 60; BPTB, 46.7%; QT, 38.3%; HT, 8.3%; allograft, 6.7%) and nonconsult group (n = 40; BPTB, 70.0%; QT, 15.0%; HT, 7.5%; allograft, 7.5%) (<i>P</i> = .0757). In the consult group, 81.7% of patients selected the graft recommended to them by their surgeon. The top 2 graft selection reasons were usage in professional athletes and failure rates, while the top 2 ACL surgery concerns were returning to their desired level of athletics and graft failure risk. Among the 93 patients who researched their ACL graft options before their visit, the most popular information source was some form of media (72.0% [67/93]).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Conclusion" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The study findings underscore the importance of patient preference and surgeon recommendation in a patient's graft selection and highlight the need to be cognizant of the information sources available to patients when researching their graft options.</AbstractText>

TI  - Twenty-Year Outcome of a Longitudinal Prospective Evaluation of Isolated Endoscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction With Patellar Tendon or Hamstring Autograft.
PY  - 2016
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND">Long-term prospective studies of isolated endoscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction are limited and may include confounding factors.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE">This study aimed to compare the outcomes of isolated ACL reconstruction using the patellar tendon (PT) autograft and the hamstring (HT) autograft in 180 patients over 20 years.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN">Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS">A total of 180 participants undergoing isolated ACL reconstruction between 1993 and 1994 were prospectively recruited. Evaluation was performed at 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, and 20 years after surgery and included the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) knee ligament evaluation with radiographic evaluation, KT-1000 arthrometer side-to-side difference, and subjective scores.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">Over 20 years, there were 16 patients (18%) and 9 patients (10%) with an ACL graft rupture in the HT and PT groups, respectively (P = .13). ACL graft rupture was associated with male sex (odds ratio [OR], 3.9; P = .007), nonideal tunnel position (OR, 3.6; P = .019), and age &lt;18 years at the time of surgery (OR, 4.6; P = .003). The odds of a contralateral ACL rupture were increased in patients with the PT graft compared with patients with the HT graft (OR, 2.2; P = .02) and those aged &lt;18 years at the time of surgery (OR, 3.4; P = .001). The mean IKDC scores at 20-year follow-up were 86 and 89 for the PT and HT groups, respectively (P = .18). At 20 years, 53% and 57% of the PT and HT groups participated in strenuous or very strenuous activities (P = .55), kneeling pain was present in 63% and 20% of the PT and HT groups (P = .018), and radiographic osteoarthritic change was found in 61% and 41% of the PT and HT groups (P = .008), respectively.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION">Compared with patients who received the HT graft, patients who received the PT graft had significantly worse outcomes with regard to radiologically detectable osteoarthritis, kneeling pain, and contralateral ACL injury. At 20-year follow-up, both HT and PT autografts continued to provide good subjective outcomes and objective stability. However, further ACL injury is common, particularly in male individuals, younger patients, and those with tunnel malposition.</AbstractText>

TI  - Knee joint kinematics with dynamic augmentation of primary anterior cruciate ligament repair - a biomechanical study.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Background
Dynamic augmentation of anterior cruciate ligament tears seems to reduce anteroposterior knee translation close to the pre-injury level. The aim of the present study is to biomechanically investigate the course of translation during a simulated early post-operative phase. It is hypothesized that anteroposterior translation is maintained at the immediate post-operative level over a simulated rehabilitation period of 50’000 gait cycles.

TI  - Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a multicenter prospective cohort study evaluating 3 different grafts using same bone drilling method.
PY  - 2011
AB  - Objective: To compare the clinical outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft (BPTBAu), BPTB allograft (BPTBAll), or hamstring (semitendinosus-gracilis) tendon autograft (HTAu), performing bone drilling with same methods in terms of transtibial drilling, orientation, positioning, and width of femoral and tibial tunnels. Design: Multicenter prospective cohort study (level of evidence II). Setting: Departments of Orthopedic Surgery of Centro Medico Teknon (Barcelona, Spain) Clinica Universitaria de Navarra (Navarra, Spain), and Clinica FREMAP (Gijon, Spain). Patients: All patients with ACL tears attending 3 different institutions between January 2004 and June 2006 were approached for eligibility and those meeting inclusion criteria finally participated in this study. Intervention: Each institution was assigned to perform a specific surgical technique. Patients were prospectively followed after undergoing ACL reconstruction with BPTBAu, BPTBAll, or HTAu, with a minimum follow-up of 24 months. Main Outcome Measures: Included knee laxity and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score. Knee laxity was assessed with the KT-1000 arthrometer (evaluated with neutral and external rotation positions) and both Lachman and pivot shift tests. Additional outcomes included main symptoms (anterior knee pain, swelling, crepitation, and instability), disturbance in knee sensation, visual analogue scale (VAS) for satisfaction with surgery, range of motion (ROM), and isokinetic knee strength. Results: There were no significant differences among the 3 groups for any of the clinical outcomes, except for a slightly greater KT-1000-measured knee laxity in external rotation in the BPTBAu compared with the other groups. All patients demonstrated grade A or B of the IKDC. The mean VAS for satisfaction with surgery in all patients was 8.5. Conclusions: The selection of the surgical technique for ACL reconstruction may be based on the surgeon's preferences.

TI  - Double-bundle arthroscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament: DOES THE EVIDENCE ADD UP?
PY  - 2008
AB  - There is a trend towards the use of double-bundle techniques for the reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament. This has not been substantiated scientifically. The functional outcome of these techniques is equivalent to that of single-bundle methods. The main advantage of a double-bundle rather than a single-bundle reconstruction should be a better rotational stability, but the validity and accuracy of systems for the measurement of rotational stability have not been confirmed. Despite the enthusiasm of surgeons for the double-bundle technique, reconstruction with a single-bundle should remain the standard method for managing deficiency of the anterior cruciate ligament until strong evidence in favour of the use of the double-bundle method is available.

TI  - Magnesium inference screw supports early graft incorporation with inhibition of graft degradation in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
PY  - 2016
AB  - Patients after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery commonly encounters graft failure in the initial phase of rehabilitation. The inhibition of graft degradation is crucial for the successful reconstruction of the ACL. Here, we used biodegradable high-purity magnesium (HP Mg) screws in the rabbit model of ACL reconstruction with titanium (Ti) screws as a control and analyzed the graft degradation and screw corrosion using direct pull-out tests, microCT scanning, and histological and immunohistochemical staining. The most noteworthy finding was that tendon graft fixed by HP Mg screws exhibited biomechanical properties substantially superior to that by Ti screws and the relative area of collagen fiber at the tendon-bone interface was much larger in the Mg group, when severe graft degradation was identified in the histological analysis at 3 weeks. Semi-quantitative immunohistochemical results further elucidated that the MMP-13 expression significantly decreased surrounding HP Mg screws with relatively higher Collagen II expression. And HP Mg screws exhibited uniform corrosion behavior without displacement or loosening in the femoral tunnel. Therefore, our results demonstrated that Mg screw inhibited graft degradation and improved biomechanical properties of tendon graft during the early phase of graft healing and highlighted its potential in ACL reconstruction.

TI  - Bone-patellar tendon-bone versus two- and four-strand hamstring tendon autografts for ACL reconstruction in young adults: a Bayesian network meta-analysis.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB), two- and four-strand hamstring tendon (4SHT and 2SHT, respectively) are the most common autografts used for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. The present study compared BPTB, 2SHT, and 4SHT for ACL reconstruction in terms of joint laxity, patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), rate of failure and anterior knee pain (AKP). The time to return to sport and the peak torque between the autografts were also compared. Finally, prognostic factors leading to worse outcomes were also investigated. It was hypothesized that all grafts yield similar proprieties in terms of joint laxity, patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) and rate of failure, but that the BPTB autograft causes a greater rate of anterior knee pain (AKP). The literature search was conducted. All clinical trials comparing BTPB and/or 2SHT, and/or 4SHT were accessed. Grafts other than BTPB and/or 4SHT and/or 2SHT were not considered. Articles reporting outcomes of allografts or synthetic grafts were not eligible, nor were those concerning revision settings. Articles reporting ACL reconstruction in patients with multi-ligament damage were also not eligible. Data from 95,575 procedures were retrieved. The median length of follow-up was 36 months. The median age of the patients was 27.5 years. With regard to joint laxity, similarity was found in terms of Lachman and Pivot shift tests between all three autografts. The BPTB demonstrated the greatest stability in terms of instrumental laxity. BPTB demonstrated the greatest PROMs. BPTB demonstrated the greatest rate of AKP, while AKP in 2SHT and 4SHT was similar. Concerning failure, statistically significant inconsistency was found (P = 0.008). The 4SHT demonstrated the quickest return to sport, followed by BPTB, and 2SHT. There was evidence of a negative association between the time span between injury to surgery, Lysholm score (P = 0.04), and Tegner scale (P = 0.04). Furthermore, there was evidence of a weak positive association between the time span between injury to surgery and return to sport (P = 0.01). BPTB may result in lower joint laxity, greater PROMs, and greater peak flexion torque compared to 2SHT and 4SHT autografts. On the other hand, BPTB reported the lowest peak extension torque and the greatest rate of AKP. Finally, a longer time span between injury and surgery negatively influences outcome.

TI  - Return to sports after ACL reconstruction: a new functional test protocol.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Background In literature, there are lack of studies proposing clear and rationally designed test battery to be performed after an ACL reconstruction. Methods From 2006 to 2015, 80 football players were subjected, after ACL reconstruction, to a newly conceived test battery analyzing: Isometric and isokinetic force productionThe different phases during the jumpThe correct control of the landing phase after jumpThe control of valgus during landing after jump and cutting movements. Results The isokinetic and isometric test do not show any significant relationship with the another test. The laboratory test as well the field test showed them a significant correlation. Conclusions The results showed that a normal force production during the laboratory does not guarantee an equally satisfactory production of force during the field test.

TI  - Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with Hamstring Tendons Has no Deleterious Effect on Hip Extension Strength.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Background: Hamstring tendons are secondary hip extensors. Their harvest for graft in anterior cruciate ligament(ACL) reconstruction may create deleterious effect on hip extension strength. This is of particular importance in sportsthat need powerful hip extension force like climbing and sprinting. Due to scarcity of a comprehensive study in thisarea, we designed this prospective study to evaluate hip extension strength following ACL reconstruction using differenttypes of grafts.Methods: Fifty eight patients were enrolled in this prospective non-randomized case control study to compareisokinetic hip extension strength following ACL reconstruction with different graft types. Twenty patients in groupA (both Semitendinosus and Gracilis tendons autograft (ST-G)), 14 patients in group B (Tibialis Posterior tendonallograft (Allograft)), 12 patients in group C (bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft (BPTB)) and 12 patients in group D(only semitendinosus autograft (ST)) were studied. Hip extension strength was tested post-operatively at three- andsix-month periods using a Biodex isokinetic testing machine at a speed of 30 degree per second in operated (cases)and non-operated (controls) limbs.Results: There was a significant increase in hip extension force between three and six month intervals in all fourgroups and in both operated (case) and non-operated (control) limbs (P<0.05, 95% CI). However, there was moreincrease in case limbs in comparison to control limbs. There was no significant difference in hip extension strengthamong all four groups (both in case and control limbs) in the third- and the sixth-month post-operative tests.Conclusion: Graft type had no effect on hip extension strength following ACL reconstruction, and the harvest of one orboth hamstrings had no deleterious effect on hip extension force.Level of evidence: III

TI  - Revision Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction
PY  - 2010
AB  - Revision reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) introduces several diagnostic and technical challenges in comparison with primary ACL reconstruction. With the increasing numbers of original reconstructions combined with the continued expectation of high-level athletic participation, revision ACL reconstruction is likely to become more frequent. The purpose of this article was to summarize the causes of failure and the evaluation of the patient with recurrent instability. A review of the literature regarding results after revision ACL reconstruction was performed to assist in the decision-making process and patient counseling. Good results can be obtained in terms of functional stability after revision reconstruction, but chondral and meniscal injury as well as unrecognized associated pathologic instability may play a role in diminished outcomes. In addition, a wide variety of surgical techniques are reviewed to address problems associated with tunnel malposition, widening, and pre-existing hardware.

TI  - Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with Use of a Single or Double-Bundle Technique in Patients with Generalized Ligamentous Laxity
PY  - 2009
AB  - Background: In a patient with generalized ligamentous laxity, the risk of instability is greater with a conventionally reconstructed anterior cruciate ligament. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical outcome of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction done with a double-bundle technique with use of a quadriceps tendon-bone autograft and that of a single-bundle reconstruction with use of a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft in patients with generalized ligamentous laxity.

Methods: The records of sixty-one patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction between June 2002 and October 2005 were evaluated. Thirty-two patients underwent a single-bundle reconstruction (group 1), and twenty-nine patients underwent a double-bundle reconstruction (group 2). Clinical outcomes were determined from data obtained before surgery and at the twenty-four-month follow-up visit.

Results: Postoperatively, the mean side-to-side difference (and standard deviation) in anterior tibial translation, measured with use of a KT-2000 arthrometer, was greater for group 1 (3.37 ± 1.76 mm; range, 1.00 to 8.00 mm) than for group 2 (2.03 ± 1.11 mm; range, 0.00 to 3.50 mm) (p = 0.02). Three patients in group 1 had a grade-1+ pivot shift, while no patient in group 2 had an abnormal pivot shift. The mean score on the Hospital for Special Surgery knee ligament questionnaire was 90.8 in group 1 and 92.1 in group 2, and the mean Lysholm score was 89.4 in group 1 and 91.1 in group 2.

Conclusions: On the basis of the evaluation of ligamentous laxity measured by the KT-2000 arthrometer, a double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with use of a quadriceps tendon-bone autograft allows less anterior translation than does a single-bundle reconstruction with use of a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft. However, we could not identify a significant difference in the functional outcome between the two techniques.

TI  - Comparison of clinical results and second-look arthroscopy findings after arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using 3 different types of grafts.
PY  - 2009
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstructive surgery by use of bone–patellar tendon–bone (BPTB) allografts, tibialis anterior tendon (TA) allografts, and hamstring tendon (HA) autografts with respect to objective knee testing measures and second-look arthroscopy. Methods We analyzed 338 patients who had undergone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction between March 2000 and February 2006. BPTB allografts were used in 60 cases, TA allografts in 153 cases, and HA autografts in 125 cases. We compared the grade of range of motion (ROM), Lachman test, pivot-shift test, KT-1000 arthrometric test (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA), and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) knee examination form, as well as second-look arthroscopic findings, at least 1 year after reconstruction. Results The preoperative ROM was not different among the 3 groups ( P > .05), but the BPTB group and TA group showed greater postoperative ROM than the HA group ( P = .028 and P P > .05). Synovial coverage of more than 50% was found in 62.5% cases in the BPTB allograft group, 72.3% cases in the TA allograft group, and 90.7% cases in the HA autograft group. The incidence of synovial coverage of more than 50% was higher in the HA autograft group than that in the BPTB and TA allograft groups ( P = .018 and P = .026, respectively). With regard to the IKDC grade, grade A or B was found in 95.2% of the cases with synovial coverage of more than 50% and in 78.3% of the cases with coverage of less than 50% ( P = .011). Conclusions There was no difference in objective knee testing measures among the 3 different graft groups except that the allograft groups showed greater postoperative ROM than the autograft group. However, the HA autograft group had better synovial coverage on second-look arthroscopy, and the group with better synovial coverage on second-look arthroscopy presented better clinical results on the IKDC objective examination form.

TI  - Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in Young Females: A Systematic Review of Patellar Tendon Versus Hamstring Tendon Autografts.
PY  - 2019
AB  - A systematic review was performed to compare patellar tendon-bone (BTB) and hamstring tendon (HS) autografts following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in young females, young patients, or females. One study compared BTB and HS in young females and found a lower rate of graft failure with BTB (P<.02). Of the 11 studies that made this comparison in females, 1 reported decreased laxity in females with BTB (P=.035). Of 4 studies comparing autografts in young patients, 1 reported a decreased rate of graft failure with BTB (P=.036). Further studies making this comparison specifically in young females are warranted. [Orthopedics. 2019; 42(3):e295-e304.].

TI  - Outcomes of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in Females Using Patellar-Tendon-Bone versus Hamstring Autografts: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PY  - 2018
AB  - The current review aims to compare the outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in the female population after patellar-tendon-bone and hamstring grafts. The review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. All original randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies that compared clinical outcomes after female ACL reconstruction using hamstring versus patellar-tendon-bone grafts were included. All clinical outcomes reported by three or more studies were included. Fifteen publications, with 948 female patients, were included. Most outcomes were reported to have no significant graft differences by all studies that reported the outcome. These included all the outcomes for objective knee scores (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] objective knee score), neuromuscular testing (quadriceps strength, hamstring strength, and single hop test), graft rupture or failure, and subjective knee scores (Lysholm score and IKDC subjective knee score). The pivot shift test, flexion deficit, and presence of crepitus were also reported to have no significant graft differences by all studies. Some studies reported a significant difference in anteroposterior laxity (Lachman's test and instrumented laxity), range of motion deficits (extension deficit), and sports and activity level (Tegner score). However, these statistically significant differences were noted to be clinically insignificant due to the normal population variation or standard error of measurement of these tools of evaluation. Patients reconstructed with patellar-tendon-bone grafts have a higher risk of kneeling pain. There was no significant difference in the incidence of crepitus. Most of the outcomes following female ACL reconstructions showed no clinically and statistically significant difference when either patellar-tendon-bone or hamstring autograft was used. These included outcomes for anteroposterior laxity, objective knee scores, neuromuscular testing, graft rupture or failure, subjective knee scores, sports and activity level, and crepitus. This a level II study.

TI  - Evaluating knee function post-ACL reconstruction: conventional versus all-inside technique using Lysholm score
PY  - 2024
AB  - <jats:p>Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is a common surgical intervention. The aim of this paper was to make a comparison in terms of subjective symptoms that occur in a specific Lysholm scoring scale-in-progress before the operative period, 3 and 8 months after surgical treatment with two surgical methods. Materials and Methods: Eighty patients underwent primary ACL reconstruction at the Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology in the City General Hospital “8th September” in Skopje in a period of two years. The first group (40 subjects) constituted the control group (CG), surgically treated with a standard method using a graft from m. semitendinosus and m. gracilis. The second group (40 subjects) was the study group (SG) surgically treated with the ALL-INSIDE method using a m. semitendinosus graft. In all subjects preoperatively, at 3 and 8 months after surgical treatment, Lysholm scale was completed representing a designed questionnaire for evaluation of subjective symptoms. Results: Preoperatively, most patients from SG had a score lower than 65 to 55 % (22), while in CG between 65 and 83 – 50% (20). After 3 months of surgical treatment, SG patients had averagely a higher score than CG patients (88.60 ± 11.8 vs. 85.75 ± 17.8), but without statistical significance. Among SG and CG patients, 8 months after surgery (p = 0.043), SG patients had a significantly higher mean score than CG patients (97.62 ± 5.3 vs. 92.40 ± 15.1). Lysholm scale analysed qualitatively 8 months after surgical treatment showed no significant difference between them, i.e., the tested difference in the distribution of patients with a score of less than 65, from 65 to 83, from 84 to 90 and more than 90, and depending on the type of the surgical method was statistically insignificant (p = 0.123).  Conclusion: The type of surgical technique used had no significant influence on the subjective complaints of patients after 3 months of surgical treatment. But after 8 months, a better functional result was obtained in SG patients</jats:p>

TI  - The optimal window for reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) with respect to quadriceps atrophies lies within 21 to 100 days.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">The study's objective was to determine the optimal window for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with respect to quadriceps atrophies and clinical outcome.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">For this retrospective, comparative study, 115 patients aged under 35 were included, who received an ACL reconstruction between 2011 and 2016. They were divided into four groups, depending on the time to surgery, to determine the optimal window for reconstruction: (group 1: ≤21 d, group 2: &lt;21d-56d≥, group 3: &gt;56d-100d≥, group 4: &gt;100d). Follow-up was performed one month postoperatively, after a mean of 4.9 (±5.3) months, and after a mean of 3.5 (±1.4) years. Primary endpoints included quadriceps muscle status, range of motion (ROM), pain, swelling, the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC), the Lysholm-Score, the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and the Tegner-Activity-Scale (TAS).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Significantly more quadriceps atrophies were observed in group 1 and group 4, representing reconstructions earlier than 21 and later than 100 days (29% and 41% vs. 9%; p = 0.032). The measurements of knee extension (p = 0.082) and ROM (p = 0.123) were comparable in all groups. Group 1 showed the least pain (0% vs. 15%; p = 0.285) and swelling (0% vs. 23%; p = 0.077) compared to all other groups one month postoperatively. A comparison of postoperative clinical scores revealed no significant differences, with group 1 exhibiting the lowest TAS levels.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">In patients who underwent ACL reconstruction within three weeks or after more than 100 days, a significantly higher incidence of quadriceps atrophy was observed, possibly attributable to the initial inflammatory phase or the delayed reconstruction affecting quadriceps function. However, this impairment may not be observable in elite athletes who undergo reconstruction within hours of the injury.</AbstractText>

TI  - Non-contact ACL injuries in female athletes: An International Olympic Committee current concepts statement
PY  - 2008
AB  - The incidence of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury remains high in young athletes. Because female athletes have a much higher incidence of ACL injuries in sports such as basketball and team handball than male athletes, the IOC Medical Commission invited a multidisciplinary group of ACL expert clinicians and scientists to (1) review current evidence including data from the new Scandinavian ACL registries; (2) critically evaluate high-quality studies of injury mechanics; (3) consider the key elements of successful prevention programmes; (4) summarise clinical management including surgery and conservative management; and (5) identify areas for further research. Risk factors for female athletes suffering ACL injury include: (1) being in the preovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle compared with the postovulatory phase; (2) having decreased intercondylar notch width on plain radiography; and (3) developing increased knee abduction moment (a valgus intersegmental torque) during impact on landing. Well-designed injury prevention programmes reduce the risk of ACL for athletes, particularly women. These programmes attempt to alter dynamic loading of the tibiofemoral joint through neuromuscular and proprioceptive training. They emphasise proper landing and cutting techniques. This includes landing softly on the forefoot and rolling back to the rearfoot, engaging knee and hip flexion and, where possible, landing on two feet. Players are trained to avoid excessive dynamic valgus of the knee and to focus on the "knee over toe position" when cutting.

TI  - Muscle strength and functional performance in patients with anterior cruciate ligament injury treated with training and surgical reconstruction or training only: A two to five-year followup.
PY  - 2008
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study muscle strength and functional performance in patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury with or without surgical reconstruction 2 to 5 years after injury. Good muscle function is important in preventing early-onset osteoarthritis (OA), but the role of reconstructive surgery in restoring muscle function is unclear. METHODS: Of 121 patients with ACL injury included in a randomized controlled trial on training and surgical reconstruction versus training only (the Knee, Anterior cruciate ligament, NON-surgical versus surgical treatment [KANON] study, ISRCTN: 84752559), 54 (mean age at followup 30 years, range 20-39, 28% women) were assessed a mean +/- SD of 3 +/- 0.9 years after injury with reliable, valid, and responsive test batteries for strength (knee extension, knee flexion, leg press) and hop performance (vertical jump, one-leg hop, side hop). The Limb Symmetry Index (LSI; injured leg divided by uninjured and multiplied by 100) value and absolute values were used for comparisons between groups (analysis of variance). An LSI >/=90% was considered normal. RESULTS: There were no differences between the surgical and nonsurgical treatment groups in muscle strength or functional performance. Between 44% and 89% of subjects had normal muscle function in the single tests, and between 44% and 56% had normal function in the test batteries. CONCLUSION: The lack of differences between patients treated with training and surgical reconstruction or training only indicates that reconstructive surgery is not a prerequisite for restoring muscle function. Abnormal muscle function, found in approximately one-third or more of the patients, may be a predictor of future knee OA. (Less)

TI  - Return to Play Following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction
PY  - 2015
AB  - In athletes, significant advances in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction techniques and rehabilitation have led to improved surgical outcomes and increased expectations for return to play. Although an expeditious return to sport has become an achievable and often realistic goal, the factors that most influence safe, timely, and successful return to play remain unknown. The literature offers mainly anecdotal evidence to guide the team physician in the decision-making process, with a paucity of criteria and consensus guidelines available to help determine return to sport. Attempts have been made to introduce criteria-based progression in the rehabilitation process, but validation of subjective and objective criteria has been difficult. Nevertheless, several pertinent factors in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative periods may affect return to play following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Further research is warranted to validate reliable, consensus guidelines with objective criteria to facilitate the return to play process.

TI  - Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction
PY  - 2017
AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is a common sports injury, and surgical reconstruction is the standard treatment in most active patients. Double-bundle (DB) ACL reconstruction is one application of the anatomic reconstruction concept, which aims to restore the ACL to its native dimensions, collagen orientation, and insertion site. Biomechanical studies have shown that anatomic DB reconstruction restores knee laxity closer to normal than transtibial single-bundle (SB) reconstruction. Several prospective, comparative clinical studies with level I or II evidence have also reported superior outcomes of anatomic DB compared with SB reconstruction. Although the best evidence from the highest-quality meta-analyses suggests that DB reconstruction yields superior postoperative knee laxity restoration when compared with SB reconstruction, the effect on clinical outcomes and risk of graft failure have not been significantly different. However, heterogeneity of studies, including differences in tunnel position and relatively short-term follow-up, is the limitation of this evidence. Future biomechanical and long-term clinical cohort studies with anatomic ACL reconstruction are needed to further examine the improvement in knee laxity and clinical outcomes afforded by DB reconstruction.

PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="Background" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The purpose of the present study was to assess the prognostic morphological changes of the reconstructed hamstring auto-grafts by using reconstructed three-dimensional MRI (3D-MRI) in adolescent patients with ACLR.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">22 adolescent patients (less than 17 years old) were retrospective included between January 1, 2018, and October 31, 2020, in our department. The patients were divided into 2 subgroups: subgroup A (&lt;14 years old) and subgroup B (≥14 years old). 3D-MRI was used to detect the total cross-sectional area (TCA) and long-to-short axis (LSA) ratio of the reconstructed ACL graft at the proximal, mid-point, and distal regions. The minimal follow-up was 2 years.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The averaged follow-up of subgroup A and B was 37.8 ± 5.6 and 37.6 ± 6.5 months, respectively. Comparing to the initial graft (ACLR operation), the TCA of reconstructed ACL was increased by 30.6% on average, and the TCAs at proximal, mid-point, and distal regions were increased by 56.4%, 50.0%, and 17.7%, respectively, inner-group comparisons showed that the TCAs of the 3 region in subgroup A were all increased at the follow-up (<i>P </i>= 0.002) (<i>P </i>&lt; 0.001) (<i>P </i>&lt; 0.001), however, only increased mid-point (<i>P </i>= 0.024) and distal TCAs (<i>P </i>&lt; 0.001) were found in subgroup B. Comparing to the native ACL, the proximal LSA ratio in subgroup A was comparable, while it was lower in subgroup B than the native ACL (<i>P </i>= 0.004), the distal LSA ratios in the 2 subgroups were both lower than the native ACL (<i>P </i>= 0.004) (<i>P </i>= 0.006).</AbstractText>

TI  - Anthropometric Measurement of Tunnel Lengths for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in Chinese
PY  - 2014
AB  - Abstract Introduction There is a lacking of tunnel length measurements data for primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in the Chinese population. Different tunnel lengths affect the security of the tendon graft fixation as well as bone–tendon healing. Long-term result may then be compromised. Double-bundle ACL reconstruction will work well if both grafts have good quality, size, and tendon–bone fixation. Proper rehabilitation is also an important element. However, the femoral tunnel length for posterolateral bundle will have a higher prevalence of inadequate graft bone contact because of its orientation, especially in the Chinese population with smaller knees compared with the Western population. Methods From January 2009 to June 2011, 148 cases of ACL reconstruction have been performed in our hospital. After excluding cases with revision, isolated bundle (anteromedial or posterolateral), and four-strand hamstring graft single-bundle ACL reconstructions, we recruited 48 cases with primary double-bundle ACL reconstruction in the study of tunnel lengths. Hamstring tendon autografts (semitendinosus and gracilis) were used. A small cohort study with Level 3 evidence was carried out. Results In 31.3% (15/48) of patients, inadequate graft–bone contact was observed in the posterolateral bundle using the available shortest Endobutton CL 15 (Endobutton continuous loop fixation device; Smith and Nephew, Andover, Massachusetts, USA) in femoral tunnel fixation. Conclusion ACL reconstruction is a complex procedure that relies on good tendon graft length, graft size, tunnel length, and secure fixation method. Inadequate posterolateral tunnel length may contribute to short-term complications as well as long-term failure. Further refining of the choices of graft, better orientation of tunnels, and a better fixation method may be important, especially in the Chinese population with smaller knees.

TI  - Quadriceps Strength following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: Normative Values based on Sex, Graft Type and Meniscal Status at 3, 6 & 9 Months.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="Background" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Higher postoperative quadriceps function has been positively associated with surgical outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). However, the impact of autograft harvest and/or a concomitant meniscal procedure on the recovery of quadriceps strength is not well defined.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Purpose" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">To describe postoperative recovery of quadriceps strength following ACLR related to autograft selection, meniscal status, and sex.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Study Design" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Retrospective Cohort.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">One hundred and twenty-five participants who underwent ACLR with either a hamstring tendon (HT), bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) or quadriceps tendon (QT) autograft were included. At postoperative months 3, 6 and 9, each participant completed an isometric quadriceps strength testing protocol at 90-degrees of knee flexion. Participants' quadriceps average peak torque (Q-AvgPKT), average peak torque relative to body weight (Q-RPKT), and calculated limb symmetry index (Q-LSI) were collected and used for data analysis. Patients were placed in groups based on sex, graft type, and whether they had a concomitant meniscal procedure at the time of ACLR. At each time point, One-way ANOVAs, independent samples t-test and chi-square analyses were used to test for any between-group differences in strength outcomes.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">At three months after ACLR, Q-RPKT was significantly higher in those with the HT compared to the QT. At all time points, males had significantly greater Q-RPKT than females and HT Q-LSI was significantly higher than BPTB and QT. A concomitant meniscal procedure at the time of ACLR did not significantly affect Q-LSI or Q-RPKT at any testing point.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Conclusion" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">This study provides outcomes that are procedure specific as well as highlights the objective progression of quadriceps strength after ACLR.

TI  - Return to Sport after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Literature Review
PY  - 2014
AB  - Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injuries are very common in an athletic population. An ACL injury is a major injury, with a devastating effect on the athletes’ sports participation. The goal after an ACL surgery is to return to sport, and ideally to the same level of sports participation as prior to the injury. In the literature, reports of returning to competitive sports at the same pre-injury level are rather low and differ from 33 to 63%. General consensus exists that a successful return to sports relies heavily on the rehabilitation program. Today it is generally believed that muscle strength, neuromuscular control and fear of re-injury are critical factors for a successful return to sports and must be considered as imperative in the rehabilitation program. In this review, these parameters are described and based upon that, some criteria for a successful return to sport are provided. Indeed, research has proven that a good rehabilitation program, with demanding criteria can reduce the risk of re-injury, prepare the athlete to perform at the same pre-injury level and secure the safe transition of the player from physiotherapy to normal training. More research is needed in order to determine exact criteria for the return to sport. This evidently will lead to a higher percentage of successful return to sport.

Method: Surveys were mailed to 197 AAOS members who were within 50 miles of the “43614” zip code. Results: A student t- test revealed no significant differences between the management of ACL injuries in athletes versus non athletes (p evidence for brace prescription, which was significant (p members surveyed did not manage ACL injuries differently in athletes or non-athletes, which is consistent with the literature. The literature is inconsistent regarding the use of knee braces postoperatively; the surgeons did not rely on the literature for brace decision making, but results were also inconclusive about their reliance on clinical experience.

TI  - Evaluation of Graft Ligamentization by MRI After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND">The tendon graft used in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) undergoes "ligamentization" after implantation, and the reported length of this process varies from 6 to 48 months. Some grafts have ruptured at subsequent follow-up evaluations. Although the progress of graft ligamentization can be followed with postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for reassessment, it is not known whether a delay in ligamentization (as reflected by a higher signal of the graft) is associated with an increased chance of subsequent graft rupture.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="HYPOTHESIS">Signal intensity of the graft on reassessment MRI (signal-noise quotient [SNQ]) would be associated with the incidence of future graft rupture at subsequent follow-up.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN">Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS">A total of 565 ACLRs with intact graft on first-time reassessment MRI after surgery were followed for a mean period of 67 months. The rates of 1-year and 2-year follow-up were 99.5% and 84.5%, respectively. The signal intensity of the intact graft on the first-time reassessment MRI was evaluated (1) quantitatively by the SNQ and (2) qualitatively with the modified Ahn classification. Among the 565 ACLRs, 23 additional graft ruptures developed during a time interval of 7 months to 9 years after the surgery.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">Higher SNQ was associated with increased chance of subsequent graft rupture (SNQ 7.3 ± 6 for subsequent graft rupture vs 4.4 ± 4 for grafts without subsequent rupture; <i>P</i> = .004, Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test). The other important confounders that were associated with increased chance of graft rupture were younger age at the time of ACLR (<i>P</i> &lt; .001) and longer follow-up time (<i>P</i> = .002). Multiple linear regression showed that all 3 factors (higher SNQ, younger age, and longer follow-up) were independent predictors of graft rupture (SNQ, <i>P</i> = .03; age, <i>P</i> &lt; .001; follow-up, <i>P</i> = .012). When the reassessment MRI was performed in the second year after ACLR, the odds ratio of future graft rupture of a heterogeneous hyperintense graft when compared with a homogeneous hypointense graft was 12.1 (95% CI = 2.8 to 52.6) <i>P</i> &lt; .001, Fisher exact test).</AbstractText>

TI  - Systemic Review With Video Illustration Factors Used to Determine Return to Unrestricted Sports Activities After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction
PY  - 2011
AB  - Purpose: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is commonly performed in athletes, with the goal of return to sports activities. Unfortunately, this operation may fail, and the rates of either reinjuring an ACL-reconstructed knee or sustaining an ACL rupture to the contralateral knee range from 3% to 49%. One problem that exists is a lack of information and consensus regarding the appropriate criteria for releasing patients to unrestricted sports activities postoperatively. The purpose of this study was to determine the published criteria used to allow athletes to return to unrestricted sports activities after ACL reconstruction. Methods: A systematic search was performed to identify the factors investigators used to determine when return to athletics was allowed after primary ACL reconstruction. Inclusion criteria were English language, publication within the last 10 years, clinical trial, all adult patients, primary ACL reconstruction, original research investigation, and minimum 12 months’ follow-up. Results: Of 716 studies identified, 264 met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 105 (40%) failed to provide any criteria for return to sports after ACL reconstruction. In 84 studies (32%) the amount of time postoperatively was the only criterion provided. In 40 studies (15%) the amount of time along with subjective criteria were given. Only 35 studies (13%) noted objective criteria required for return to athletics. These criteria included muscle strength or thigh circumference (28 studies), general knee examination (15 studies), single-leg hop tests (10 studies), Lachman rating (1 study), and validated questionnaires (1 study). Conclusions: The results of this systematic review show noteworthy problems and a lack of objective assessment before release to unrestricted sports activities. General recommendations are made for quantification of muscle strength, stability, neuromuscular control, and function in patients who desire to return to athletics after ACL reconstruction, with acknowledgment of the need for continued research in this area. Level of Evidence: Level IV, systematic review of Level I to IV studies.

TI  - Revision ACL Reconstruction
PY  - 2021
AB  - Outcomes after revision anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction are less favorable than primary ACL reconstruction, highlighting the importance of meticulous preoperative planning and operative technique when approaching revision surgery. All patients presenting with ACL reconstruction failure should undergo a thorough history and physical exam, including reviewing the clinical and operative notes, as well as preoperative imaging, from the index surgery. Standard radiographs, including standing anterior-posterior, weight bearing 45° flexion posterior-anterior, lateral, and Merchant views, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be obtained during the initial workup. Additionally, the authors obtain a thin-cut computed tomography (CT) scan with 3-dimensional (3D) reconstructions on all revision cases for planning purposes. The most important aspect of the preoperative workup is identifying the cause(s) of the index ACL reconstruction failure. Reasons for failure include repeat traumatic event, technical or biological failure of the index procedure, mechanical malalignment or bony morphology, concomitant ligamentous or meniscal injury, or infection. During revision ACL reconstruction, concomitant injuries should be addressed appropriately. Revision surgery can be one-stage or two-stage depending on condition of the prior tibial and femoral tunnels or concomitant pathology such as malalignment or infection. A detailed surgical plan should be created and individualized for each individual patient.

TI  - Original Article With Video Illustrations Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Patellar Tendon Versus Hamstring Tendon: A Prospective Comparative Study With 9-Year Follow-Up
PY  - 2011
AB  - Purpose: To analyze the long-term evaluation of clinical, functional, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results after implant-free press-fit anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with bone‐patella tendon (BPT) versus quadrupled hamstring tendon (HT) grafts. Methods: Sixtytwo ACL-insufficient patients were included in a prospective, randomized study (31 BPT and 31 HT). Both surgical procedures were performed without any implants by a press-fit technique by the senior author. The femoral tunnel was drilled through the anteromedial portal for anatomic placement. At 8.8 years after reconstruction, 53 patients (28 BPT and 25 HT) were examined by different clinical and functional tests. Bilateral MRI scans were performed and interpreted by an independent radiologist. Results: On follow-up, the score on the International Knee Documentation Committee evaluation form was significantly better in the HT group. The clinical examination including range of motion, KT-1000 test (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA), and pivot-shift test showed no significant differences. On isokinetic testing, the mean quadriceps strength was close to normal (96%) in both groups, but the hamstring strength was lower in the HT group (100.3%/95.1%). Kneeling (1.5/1.1, P .002), knee walking (1.72/1.14, P .002), and single-leg hop test (95.8%/99.1%, P .057) were better in the HT group. The MRI findings about the mean degree of cartilage lesion (International Cartilage Repair Society protocol) of the operated (2.1/2.1) and nonoperated (1.4/1.8) knee showed no significant differences. No significant difference was found in the grade of medial or lateral meniscal lesion or the number of patients having meniscal lesions when the operated and nonoperated knees were compared. Tunnel measurements, Caton-Deschamps Index, and the sagittal ACL angle were similar. Conclusions: The implant-free press-fit technique for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by use of bone‐patellar tendon and hamstring grafts with anatomic graft placement is an innovative technique to preserve the cartilage and meniscal status without significant differences between the operated and nonoperated knees in the long term. Significantly less anterior knee pain was noted in the hamstring group, when testing for kneeling and knee walking. Level of Evidence: Level II, prospective comparative study.

TI  - A new neural network model that detects graft ruptures and contralateral anterior cruciate ligament injuries.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">The purpose of this study was to develop a neural network model for predicting second anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk following ACL reconstruction using patient features from medical records.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Of 486 consecutive patients who underwent primary unilateral ACL reconstruction, 386 patients (198 women, 188 men) with a mean age of 25.1 ± 11.6 years were included in this study. Fifty-eight features, including demographic data, surgical, preoperative and postoperative data, were retrospectively collected from medical records, and features with an incidence of less than 5% were excluded. Finally, 14 features were used for the analysis. The multilayer perceptron was composed of four hidden layers with a rectified linear unit as activation and was trained to maximise the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (auROC). Subsequently, validation was carried out through a rigorous threefold cross-validation process. To ascertain the most efficacious combination of features with the highest auROC, a single feature with the least impact on auROC maximisation was systematically eliminated from the comprehensive variable set, ultimately resulting in the retention of a mere two variables.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The median follow-up period was 50.5 (24-142) months. Fifty-seven knees had a second ACL injury, with a graft rupture rate of 7.7% and a contralateral injury rate of 6.9%. The maximum auROC for predicting graft rupture was 0.81 with two features: young age and hamstring graft. Meanwhile, the maximum auROC for predicting contralateral ACL injury was 0.74 with seven features, including young age, presence of medial meniscus tear, small body mass index, hamstring graft, female sex and medial meniscus repair or treatment.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">A neural network model with patient features from medical records detected graft ruptures and contralateral ACL injuries with acceptable accuracy. This model can serve as a new, useful tool in clinical practice to inform decisions about ACL reconstruction and retuning to sports postoperatively.</AbstractText>

TI  - Advantages and Potential Consequences of Return to Sport After ACL Reconstruction: Quality of Life, Reinjury Rates, and Knee Osteoarthritis
PY  - 2019
AB  - The topic of return to sport (RTS) after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction has become the subject of increased scrutiny as a result of publications citing high reinjury rates upon return to high-risk sports postoperatively, as well as disappointing percentages of athletes who are able to RTS. Because the majority of patients who undergo ACL reconstruction are young athletes, the ability to return these individuals to their desired sports levels is paramount and is highly correlated with overall satisfaction and quality of life. This chapter discusses long-term data from ACL reconstruction studies, including reinjury rates and the factors that are most likely related to increased risk of developing arthritis. Reinjury rates (to the ACL in either knee) differ among studies, and it is unclear whether reinjuries are due to younger patient age or participation in high-risk activities per se; failure to restore normal neuromuscular indices (to both knees) may be one major source of this problem. The majority of ACL reconstruction studies show favorable results in terms of improved knee stability and function, and the rates of osteoarthritis (OA) vary widely. Whether RTS after ACL reconstruction correlates with eventual symptomatic OA is unknown at present.

TI  - Return to play following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: incorporating fatigue into a return to play functional battery. Part A: treadmill running.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Background The risk of reinjury and other sequelae following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) remains high. Lack of knowledge regarding factors contributing to these risks limits our ability to develop sensitive return to play (RTP) tests. Using a running task, we evaluate whether fatigue induces alterations in foot progression angle (FPA), a proposed biomechanical risk factor and could be used to enhance RTP test sensitivity. Method Transverse plane foot kinematics (FPA) were assessed for 18 post-ACLR subjects during a treadmill running task, before and after a generalised lower limb fatigue protocol. Subject’s contralateral limbs were used as a control group. Results A small but significant difference between FPA for ACLR and contralateral limbs was observed before but not after fatigue. When confounding variables were considered, there was a significant difference in FPA change between ACLR and contralateral limbs from the prefatigue to postfatigue state. Conclusions Following ACLR athletes may develop a knee-protective movement strategy that delays the progression of osteoarthritis in the ACL-injured knee. This may, however, increase the risk of ACL reinjury. Following the onset of fatigue this proposed movement strategy, and thus osteoarthritis protection, is lost.

TI  - The impact of bone graft type used to fill bone defects in patients undergoing ACL reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autograft on kneeling, anterior knee pain and knee functional outcomes.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">Multiple different materials are used for filling bone defects following bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) graft ACL reconstruction surgery. The theoretical objective being to minimize kneeling pain, improve clinical outcomes and reduce anterior knee pain following surgery. The impact of these materials is assessed in this study.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">A prospective monocentric cohort study was conducted from January 2018 to March 2020. There were 128 skeletally mature athletic patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using the same arthroscopic-assisted BPTB technique, with a minimum follow-up of two years identified in our database. After obtaining approval from the local ethics committee, 102 patients were included in the study. Patients were divided into three groups based on type of bone substitute. The Bioactive glass 45S5 ceramic Glassbone™ (GB), collagen and hydroxyapatite bone void filler in sponge form Collapat® II (CP), and treated human bone graft Osteopure®(OP) bone substitutes were used according to availability. Clinical evaluation of patients at follow-up was performed using the WebSurvey software. A questionnaire completed in the 2nd post-operative year included three items: The ability to kneel, the presence of donor site pain, and the palpation of a defect. Another assessment tool included the IKDC subjective score and Lysholm score. These two tools were completed by patients preoperatively, and postoperatively on three occasions (6 months, 1 year, and 2 years).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">A total of 102 patients were included in this study. In terms of Kneeling pain, the percentage of GB and CP patients' who kneel with ease were much higher than that of OP patients (77.78%, 76.5% vs 65.6%, respectively). All three groups experienced an important increase in IKDC and Lysholm scores. There was no difference in anterior knee pain between the groups.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The use of Glassbone® and Collapat II® bone substitutes reduced the incidence of kneeling pain compared to Osteopure®. There was no influence of the bone substitute type on the functional outcome of the knee or on the anterior knee pain at two years of follow.</AbstractText>

TI  - The Relationship between Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury and Osteoarthritis of the Knee
PY  - 2015
AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are a common injury, particularly in the athletic and youth populations. The known association between ACL injury and subsequent osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee merits a more in-depth understanding of the relationship between the ACL-injured knee and osteoarthritis. ACL injury, especially with concomitant meniscal or other ligamentous pathology, predisposes the knee to an increased risk of osteoarthritis. ACL insufficiency results in deterioration of the normal physiologic knee bending culminating in increased anterior tibial translation and increased internal tibial rotation. This leads to increased mean contact stresses in the posterior medial and lateral compartments under anterior and rotational loading. However, surgical reconstruction of the ACL has not been shown to reduce the risk of future OA development back to baseline and has variability based on operative factors of graft choice, timing of surgery, presence of meniscal and chondral abnormalities, and surgical technique. Known strategies to prevent OA development are applicable to patients with ACL deficiency or after ACL reconstruction and include weight management, avoidance of excessive musculoskeletal loading, and strength training. Reconstruction of the ACL does not necessarily prevent osteoarthritis in many of these patients and may depend on several external variables.

TI  - Predictors of Complications after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury
PY  - 2015
AB  - BACKGROUND: An anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear is a serious knee injury that frequently affects young individuals active in soccer, alpine skiing, handball and basketball. Regardless of treatment, an ACL injury is associated with an increased risk of complications in the short and long term, such as meniscal and chondral injuries or a need to undergo surgery on the injured knee or the contralateral knee. In order to prevent these complications, the essential first step is to obtain knowledge of factors that make certain individuals susceptible to certain complications. AIM: The aim of this thesis was to investigate patientand health carerelated factors and identify predictors of meniscal injury, chondral injury, revision surgery and contralateral ACL reconstruction. METHODS: This thesis is based on six studies. Studies I-III are systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials and cohort studies. Studies IV-VI are registry-based cohort studies of patients in the Swedish National Knee Ligament Register. RESULTS: Individuals with an ACL injury who underwent non-surgical treatment ran a more than 10 times higher risk of sustaining meniscal injuries and an at least 4 times higher risk of requiring meniscal surgery compared with individuals who underwent ACL reconstruction. Adolescents (individuals aged 13 to 19 years) who underwent ACL reconstruction ran a 2 to 3 times higher risk of revision surgery or contralateral ACL reconstruction. Adolescents who suffered an ACL injury while playing soccer ran a 3 times higher risk of revision surgery. Females who underwent ACL reconstruction with harvest of a contralateral hamstring tendon autograft ran a more than 3 times higher risk of future contralateral ACL reconstruction. CONCLUSIONS: Non-surgical treatment, age 13 to 19 years, injury during soccer and contralateral hamstring tendon harvest were predictors of serious complications after ACL injury.

TI  - Contralateral Anterior Cruciate Ligament Rupture 11 Years or More Post ACL Repair With Either Hamstring Tendon or Patellar Tendon Autografts
PY  - 2014
AB  - Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are common but devastating injuries. After ACL reconstruction there is an elevated risk of rupture to the contralateral ACL, and this risk may be increased over time with patellar tendon autografts. Does risk of rupture increase for the contralateral ACL 11 years or more after ACL reconstruction when using a patellar tendon versus a hamstring tendon autograft? Methods: An exhaustive search of available medical literature was conducted using Medline-OVID, PubMed, and CINAHL using the keywords: anterior cruciate ligament, contralateral, rupture, and long term. Results were limited to human studies. Relevant article were assessed for quality using the GRADE criteria. Results: Two studies met inclusion and exclusion criteria for this systematic review. One randomized controlled trial enrolled 64 patients who underwent arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with either a hamstring tendon (HT) autograft or patellar tendon (PT) autograft and were followed for 11 years. After 11 years of follow-up, there were 6% (n=2) of patients with HT autograft ruptures and 12% (n=4) with PT graft ruptures. A cohort study of 180 patients underwent arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with either a HT or PT autograft; they were followed for 15 years. After 15 years, patients receiving PT autografts (26% (n=23)) experienced twice as many contralateral ACL ruptures compared to those with HT autografts (12% (n=11)). Conclusion: Hamstring tendon autografts appear to be superior to patellar tendon autografts with a reduced risk of contralateral anterior cruciate ligament rupture 11 or more years after ACL reconstruction.

TI  - Anterior Cruciate Ligament Surgery: Risk Factors for Development of Osteoarthritis: What Can We Do to Prevent It?
PY  - 2012
AB  - The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is well known as a risk factor for knee osteoarthritis (OA) with or without reconstruction. Oiestad et al. [36] reported the prevalence of knee OA of ACL-injured subjects treated surgically or nonsurgically in their systematic review. They concluded that the highest rated studies on methodology reported low prevalence of knee OA for individuals with isolated ACL injury (0–13 %) and a higher prevalence for ACL-injured subjects combined with meniscus and/or medial collateral ligament injury (21–48 %). Their group also reported prevalence of OA at 10–15 years’ follow-up after ACL reconstruction with bone-patella tendon-bone (BTB) autograft [37]. The total prevalence of radiographic knee OA after ACL surgery was 74 % (the Kellgren and Lawrence -K&L- grade over 2), and subjects with combined injury had significantly higher prevalence of OA compared with isolated injury (80 and 62 %, K&L grade over 2), but no significant group differences were shown for symptomatic radiographic knee OA (46 and 32 % defined as K&L grade over 2 with knee pain during past 4 weeks). In addition, this study showed that radiographic knee OA (including both isolated and combined ACL injury, BTB, and hamstring tendon autograft) was detected in 71 % (K&L grade over 2), and 24 % showed moderate or severe radiographic knee OA (K&L grades 3 and 4) [39].

AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) repair remains one of the most common surgeries in orthopedics and traumatology. The evolution of the ACL repair technique continues, new fixators appear, and the position of the graft, its shape and size are modified. Semi-tendon and gracilis muscle (STG) grafts are the most common used due to low-trauma and technically simple method of obtaining. Its disadvantage is a long period of intratunnel incorporation, one of the ways of this acceleration is the implantation of a polypropylene mesh. In an experiment on rabbits, we proved its positive effect. Objective. To develop a method of improving the intratunnel incorporation of STG-graft at ACL repair of the knee joint using polypropylene mesh. Methods. Results of 75 patients were analyzed. The study group consisted of 35 patients who underwent surgery during 2018–2019 using polypropylene mesh, comparative group — 40 patients who had surgical treatment in 2017. Evaluated demographic data, pre-operation period, recovery functions, complications rate, data of KOOS and IKDC scales. Results. Non-specific data of the inflammatory process (CRP and ESR) did not change significantly in patients with inserted polypropylene mesh. They did not have more pronounced pain after surgery, there were less cases of reactive synovitis with significantly minimized the number of the knee joint punctures. Restorationof knee function was faster, and early weight bearing of the leg allowed up to 6 months. Better results by the KOOS and IKDC scales received after surgery. Conclusions. Implantation of polypropylene mesh around the intratunnel part of STG-graft at ACL repair surgery did not increase the complications rate and allowed to improve the dynamics of limb function recovery up to 6 months after surgery.

TI  - Agreement between test procedures for the single-leg hop for distance and the single-leg mini squat as measures of lower extremity function.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Different test procedures are often used within performance-based measures, causing uncertainty as to whether results can be compared between studies. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess agreement between different test procedures for the single-leg hop for distance (SLHD) and the single-leg mini squat (SLMS), respectively, two commonly used tasks for assessing deficiency in lower extremity muscle function. Twenty-three participants (20–42 years) with lower extremity injury performed the SLHD with arms free and with arms behind back, and the Limb Symmetry Index (LSI; injured leg divided by uninjured and multiplied by 100) was calculated. Another group of 28 participants (mean 18–38 years) performed five SLMSs at a pre-defined speed and maximum number of SLMSs during 30 seconds, and were visually observed and scored as either having a knee-over-foot or a knee-medial-to-foot position (KMFP). No systematic difference between test procedures for the LSI of the SLHD was noted (p=0.736), Cohen’s kappa = 0.42. The Bland & Altman plot showed wide limits of agreement between test procedures, with particularly poor agreement for participants with abnormal LSI (<90%). Ten participants were scored as having a KMFP during five SLMSs at a predefined speed, while five had a KMFP during maximum number of SLMSs during 30 seconds (p=0.063, Cohen’s kappa = 0.56). The moderate agreement between the two test procedures for the SLHD and the SLMS, respectively, indicate that results from these different test procedures should not be compared across studies. SLHD with arms behind back, and five SLMSs at a pre-defined speed, respectively, were the most sensitive procedures to detect individuals with poor functional performance.

TI  - Return to Sports: A Risky Business? A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis of Risk Factors for Graft Rupture Following ACL Reconstruction.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND">The risk of sustaining a graft rupture after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is high. Contributing risk factors are, however, still not clearly identified.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVE">The aim of this systematic review was to identify and quantify risk factors for graft rupture after ACLR.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS">A systematic review with meta-analysis (PROSPERO CRD42020140129) based on PRISMA guidelines was performed. MEDLINE, CINAHL and EMBASE were searched from inception to September 2021. Prospective and retrospective studies addressing risk factors for graft rupture after ACLR in males/females of all ages were considered. Meta-analyses using a random effect model (effect measure: odds ratio [OR] with 95% confidence interval [CI]) were performed. The GRADE tool was used to assess evidence quality.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">Following full-text screening of 310 relevant papers, 117 were eventually included, incorporating up to 133,000 individuals in each meta-analysis. Higher Tegner activity level (≥ 7 vs &lt; 7) at primary injury (OR 3.91, 95% CI 1.69-9.04), increased tibial slope (degrees) (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.26-3.86), lower psychological readiness to return to sport (RTS) (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.32-3.61), early surgery (&lt; 12 vs ≥ 12 months) (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.58-2.22), RTS (pre-injury level) (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.21-2.91) and family history of ACL injury (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.34-2.31) were all associated with increased odds of graft rupture. Higher age (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.39-0.59), female sex (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79-0.98), fewer self-reported knee symptoms pre-reconstruction (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.69-0.95) and concomitant cartilage injuries (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.62-0.79) instead decreased the odds. Meta-analysis revealed no association between body mass index, smoking, joint laxity, RTS time, knee kinematics, muscle strength or hop performance and graft rupture.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION">Conspicuous risk factors for graft rupture were mainly sports and hereditary related. Few studies investigated function-related modifiable factors or included sports exposure data.</AbstractText>

TI  - Proprioception After Knee Injury, Surgery and Rehabilitation
PY  - 2018
AB  - Proprioception, which is derived from Latin word ‘proprius’, meaning one’s own, refers to the ability to conduct position sense of the body, interpret the data processed and respond consciously or unconsciously to stimuli of appropriate execution of posture or movement. Proprioception allows the perception of the position of the joints and maintains balance, while standing in the presence of complete visual impairment. It can be defined as the ability to perceive the position of limb or joint in space with movement and related influential factors and respond reasonably maintaining safety at the utmost level. The most common proprioceptive measurement methods used in sports traumatology include joint position sense (JPS) and threshold to perception of passive movement (TPM). The majority of these tests are used to analyse the perception rate and acuity of the position and movement. Currently, it is considered that proprioception plays a more critical role rather than pain in understanding the aetiology of degenerative joint diseases and chronic injuries and the protection against damages. For pathologies at the knee joint, proprioceptive deficit of the knee joint may develop in two ways: (i) abnormal tissue stress and (ii) inflammation process with motor control and pain. Several factors including the presence of oedema in the knee joint, the direction and degree of the patellar position, active vs. passive test procedure may lead to altered sense of joint position. It seems that the relationship of proprioception with other performance criteria including muscle strength, laxity and balance will attract further attention in the next years. This chapter discusses knee proprioceptive level after injury, surgery and rehabilitation from a proprioceptive, neuromuscular control basis. The chapter includes proprioceptive and kinaesthetic consideration after (i) patellofemoral pain syndrome, (ii) ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) injury/surgery and (iii) meniscal injury/surgery and therapeutic considerations that optimize knee function.

TI  - Kneeling tolerance when using quadriceps tendon autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is superior to hamstring tendon autograft.
PY  - 2025
AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">To investigate kneeling tolerance in patients undergoing hamstring (HT) versus quadriceps (QT) anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and investigate correlation with patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">After recruitment and randomisation, 112 patients (HT = 55; QT = 57) underwent ACLR. Patients were assessed at 6, 12 and 24 months using the Kneeling Tolerance Test, which evaluates patient-reported pain in a position of both 90 (KT90) and 110 (KT110) degrees of knee flexion. PROMs collected included the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) questionnaire and the ACL Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) questionnaire.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Kneeling tolerance at KT90 and KT110 improved (p &lt; 0.05) for both graft types across all time points. There was no difference in KT90 scores between groups at 6 or 12 months. At 24 months, kneeling tolerance was superior in the QT group (mean HT 93 ± 9 vs. QT 98 ± 5; p = 0.003). For KT110 scores, a statistically significant difference was noted at 6 (mean HT 80 ± 25 vs. QT 89 ± 12; p = 0.027), 12 (mean HT 90 ± 13 vs. QT 95 ± 10; p = 0.040) and 24 months (mean HT 92 ± 10 vs. QT 97 ± 5; p = 0.003). The ACL-RSI was significantly correlated with KT90 and KT110 at 24 months (r = 0.40, p &lt; 0.001; r = 0.40, p &lt; 0.001). Other PROMs demonstrated significant weak-to-moderate correlations with kneeling tolerance.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Patients undergoing ACLR with a QT versus HT autograft report superior kneeling tolerance up to 2 years postsurgery, more prominent in deeper (110°) knee flexion. A strong correlation with ACL-RSI was demonstrated at 2 years.</AbstractText>

AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are among the most commonly studied orthopaedic injuries. Despite having an excellent prognosis, complications do occur. The timely recognition and management of complications is imperative to ensure the success of reconstruction. Avoiding such complications requires thorough preoperative planning, proficient technical skills to properly manage intraoperative complications, and an extensive knowledge of possible postoperative complications.

TI  - Graft Choice in ACL Reconstruction: Which One and Why?
PY  - 2012
AB  - Graft choice for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction remains a debated and unsolved issue. Currently available auto- and fresh frozen allografts exhibit satisfactory mechanical properties for ACL reconstruction. The issue relates more to the outcome, in terms of residual laxity and pivot shift, harvesting morbidity, and functional outcome. Bone-patellar tendon-bone, hamstring tendons, and allografts are the more widely used grafts. Comparative randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses do not clearly demonstrate the superiority of one type of graft versus another. However, almost all these studies exhibit scientific bias which explains conflicting results. Many factors contribute to the final decision of which graft is used to reconstruct the ACL. Factors as patient’s age, life style, activity level, preexisting comorbidities, and associated injuries must be considered.

PY  - 2012
AB  - Several factors have played a prominent role in the successful transition from inpatient to outpatient ACL reconstruction over the past 25 years, including (1) advances in surgical technique (two-incision arthroscopic to single-incision endoscopic); (2) improved understanding of perioperative complications such as pain and nausea; (3) decreased or similar rates of postoperative arthrofibrosis, hemarthrosis, and deep venous thrombosis; (4) increased patient satisfaction; and (5) significant cost savings. Today, outpatient ACL surgery is a routine, safe, and cost-effective experience.

TI  - Rehabilitation for Patients Following ACL Reconstruction: A Knee Symmetry Model.
PY  - 2009
AB  - This clinical commentary outlines a new clinical model for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rehabilitation, the Knee Symmetry Model. This model has been developed by clinical observation, patient interaction, and by analyzing outcome measures derived from prospective follow-up of patients. More specifically, the best outcome scores occurred in patients with symmetric range of motion and strength. A thorough discussion of the details involved in the development and implementation of this rehabilitation program for this patient following ACL reconstruction is described. Included in this description is the supporting evidence and clinical rationale behind pre-operative and post-operative ACL rehabilitation. Preliminary results from a recent group of patients are presented. When using the Knee Symmetry Model 100% of patients achieved normal knee extension and 97% of patients achieved normal knee flexion.

TI  - A Study of the Functional Outcome of Supplementation of Hamstring Graft With Anterior Half of the Peroneus Longus Tendon in Arthroscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="INTRODUCTION" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">The present study was done to analyze the functional outcome, donor site morbidities, and associated parameters when using the anterior half of the peroneus longus for augmentation of an inadequate hamstring graft when performing arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Thirty patients with complete ACL tears were operated on. In all these patients, the thickness or length of the hamstring graft taken was found to be inadequate (less than 8 mm and 7.5 cm, respectively). So, additionally, the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon (AHPLT) graft was harvested to reach an optimum size of the final graft. Functional outcome was assessed using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score at six weeks, three months, and six months. The Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) score at six months was used to assess ankle stability.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The mean age in our study was 28.8 years with male predominance (73.33%). The mean operative time was 86.4 minutes. The mean hamstring graft thickness in our study was 6.5 mm, which improved to 9.12 mm after augmentation. The mean graft length after AHPLT augmentation was 9.38 cm. The mean IKDC score at six months was 87.35. At the end of six months, FADI scores were found within normal limits (range: 135-136) in all the patients. No complications were noted in any of the patients.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The AHPLT graft was always found to be sufficient enough for augmenting the hamstring graft to reach an acceptable thickness and length. There was no graft site morbidity and the ankle functional levels remained the same as preoperative levels, making it an excellent choice for augmentation of inadequate hamstring grafts.</AbstractText>

TI  - Combined Anterior Cruciate Ligament and Anterolateral Ligament Reconstruction Using a Single Achilles Tendon Allograft: A Technical Note.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Clinical outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) have improved remarkably. However, residual rotational instability of the knee joint remains a major concern. The anterolateral ligament (ALL) has recently gained interest as a secondary stabilizer of knee joint rotatory instability, and this has led to the attempt of ALL reconstruction (ALLR) in combination with ACLR to restore rotational stability in patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Although several techniques for ALLR have recently been introduced, the ideal graft type and surgical technique for combined ACLR and ALLR are yet to be established. This technical note therefore aimed at introducing a novel surgical procedure involving the use of a single Achilles tendon allograft as a relatively simple and minimally invasive procedure for combined ALL and ACL reconstruction.

TI  - Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Surgery Outcomes: A Comparison Between Patients Who Underwent the Procedure During the COVID-19 Pandemic and a Cohort Treated Prior to the Pandemic.
PY  - 2024
AB  - Background and objective During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many elective orthopedic surgeries, including anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), were temporarily postponed. The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of ACLR in patients who underwent surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic with those in a cohort treated before the pandemic. Materials and methods This retrospective review compared patients who underwent primary ACLR during two periods: March to June 2020 (the pandemic group) and January to December 2018 (the pre-pandemic group). Matched cohorts (1:1) were created using propensity matching. Time from injury-to-first visit, injury-to-surgery, and first visit-to-surgery were calculated. Subjective and objective outcomes, minimal clinically important difference (MCID) achievement, and complication rates were recorded for up to two years postoperatively. Statistical analysis included 𝛘2 or Fisher's exact tests for categorical data, and t- or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for continuous data with significance set at <i>P </i>< 0.05. Results The pandemic and pre-pandemic groups consisted of 33 and 217 patients, respectively. Matched cohorts consisted of 33 patients each. The time from injury-to-surgery and the first visit-to-surgery was prolonged in the pandemic group. When unmatched, visual analog scale (VAS) scores at three months postoperatively and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-pain interference (PI) at six months postoperatively and at the final follow-up were higher in the pandemic group. When matched, PROMIS-PI at six months postoperatively was higher in the pandemic group, and VAS scores at one year postoperatively were higher in the pre-pandemic group. MCID achievement and complication rates did not significantly differ between the groups. Conclusions ACLR procedures were significantly delayed in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. While patients treated before and during the pandemic experienced varying pain levels during recovery, their functional outcomes, MCID achievement, and complication rates did not differ significantly.

TI  - Novel Insights into Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury
PY  - 2011
AB  - textabstractAnterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is one of the most common sports injuries of
the knee. ACL reconstruction has become, standard orthopaedic practice worldwide
with an estimated 175,000 reconstructions per year in the United States.6 The ACL
remains the most frequently studied ligament in orthopaedic research. Hundreds of
papers are published each year related to the ACL. However, the treatment options
and techniques are still developing and increasing, indicating the difficulties in the
treatment of this central knee ligament.

TI  - Graft Failure and Contralateral ACL Injuries After Primary ACL Reconstruction: An Analysis of Risk Factors Using Interpretable Machine Learning.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="Background" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR) can be successful in restoring knee stability. However, secondary ACL injury, either through graft failure or contralateral injury, is a known complication and can significantly impact the ability of a patient to return successfully to previous activities.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Purpose" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">To develop and internally validate an interpretable machine learning model to quantify the risk of graft failure and contralateral ACL injury in a longitudinal cohort treated with ACLR.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Study Design" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">An established geographic database of &gt;600,000 patients was used to identify patients with a diagnosis of ACL rupture between 1990 and 2016 with a minimum 2-year follow-up. Medical records were reviewed for relevant patient information and 4 candidate machine learning algorithms were evaluated for prediction of graft failure and contralateral ACL injury in patients after ACLR as identified either on magnetic resonance imaging or via arthroscopy. Performance of the algorithms was assessed through discrimination, calibration, and decision curve analysis. Model interpretability was enhanced utilizing global variable importance plots and partial dependence curves.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A total of 1497 patients met inclusion criteria. Among them, 140 (9.4%) had graft failure and 128 (8.6%) had a contralateral ACL injury after index surgery at a median follow-up of 140.7 months (interquartile range, 77.2-219.2 months). The best performing models achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.70 for prediction of graft failure and 0.67 for prediction of contralateral ACL injury, outperforming a logistic regression fitted on the identical feature set. Notable predictors for increased risk of graft failure included younger age at injury, body mass index (BMI) &lt;30, return to sports &lt;13 months, initial time to surgery &gt;75 days, utilization of allograft, femoral/tibial fixation with suspension/expansion devices, concomitant collateral ligament injury, and active or former smoking history. Predictors of contralateral ACL injury included greater preoperative pain, younger age at initial injury, BMI &lt;30, active smoking history, initial time to surgery &gt;75 days, history of contralateral knee arthroscopies, and involvement in contact sports.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Conclusion" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Less than 18% of all patients who undergo ACLR should be expected to sustain either a graft failure or contralateral ACL injury. Machine learning models outperformed logistic regression and identified greater preoperative pain, younger age, BMI &lt;30, earlier return to higher activity, and time to surgical intervention &gt;75 days as common risk factors for both graft failure as well as contralateral ACL injury after ACLR. Surgeon-modifiable risk factors for graft failure included allograft and femoral/tibial fixation with a suspension/expansion combination.</AbstractText>

TI  - High-speed spinning of collagen microfibers comprising aligned fibrils for creating artificial tendons.
PY  - 2024
AB  - Bundles of engineered collagen microfibers are promising synthetic tendons as substitutes for autogenous grafts. The purpose of this study was to develop high-speed and continuous spinning of collagen microfibers that involves stretching of collagen stream. Our study revealed the 'critical fibrillogenesis concentration (CFC)' of neutralized collagen solutions, which is defined as the upper limit of the collagen concentration at which neutralized collagen molecules remain stable as long as they are cooled (⩽10 °C). Neutralized collagen solutions at collagen concentrations slightly below the CFC formed cord-like collagen gels comprising longitudinally aligned fibrils when extruded from nozzles into an ethanol bath. Dry collagen microfibers with a controlled diameter ranging from 122 ± 2-31.2 ± 1.7 μm can be spun from the cord-like gels using nozzles of various sizes. The spinning process was improved by including stretching of collagen stream to further reduce diameter and increase linear velocity. We extruded a collagen solution through a 182 μm diameter nozzle while simultaneously stretching it in an ethanol bath during gelation and fiber formation. This process resembles the stretching of a melted thermoplastic resin because it solidifies during melt spinning. The mechanical properties of the stretched collagen microfibers were comparable to the highest literature values obtained using microfluidic wet spinning, as they exhibited longitudinally aligned fibrils both on their surface and in their core. Previous wet spinning methods were unable to generate collagen microfibers with a consistent tendon-like fibrillar arrangement throughout the samples. Although the tangent modulus (137 ± 7 MPa) and stress at break of the swollen bundles of stretched microfibers (13.8 ± 1.9 MPa) were lower than those of human anterior cruciate ligament, they were within the same order of magnitude. We developed a spinning technique that produces narrow collagen microfibers with a tendon-like arrangement that can serve as artificial fiber units for collagen-based synthetic tendons.

TI  - 7 to 22Y Follow-up of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction : from the standpoint of OA
PY  - 2010
AB  - 1 Purpose: To evaluate the long term outcomes of the ACL reconstruction from the standpoint of osteoarthritis. Materials and Methods: We evaluated 31 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction from April 1986 to April 1999 and could be followed-up more than 7 years. Mean follow-up period was 10.1 years (7~22 years). In terms of the graft, 11 cases were treated with the ACL reconstruction using a autologous hamstring tendon graft, 20 cases were treated with using a autologous bone patellar tendon bone graft. For femoral tunnel, 11 cases were placed through transtibial tunnel, 20 cases were placed through anteromedial portal using mini-open arthrotomy. Functional and radiographic evaluation was performed. Results: Mean Lysholm score was 89.2±11.7 points. Patients had KT-2000 side-to-side differences were 2.1±1.9 mm. IKDC lig- ament evaluation showed 38.7% type A, 48.3% type B, 6.5% type C and 6.5% type D. Femoral tunnel were placed at 11 or 1 o' clock position in transtibial technique and placed 10 to 10:30 or 2 to 2:30 o' clock position in technique using anteromedial portal. Radiographic analysis for degenerative arthritis revealed that in group using anteromedial tunnel, 50.0% were excellent, 25.0% were good. In group using transtibial tunnel 18.2% were excellent, 18.2% were good. Conclusion: More than 87.1% of cases, long term result of the ACL reconstruction showed good and excellent result in IKDC score. Especially, the group using tunnel through anteromedial portal showed good results for degenerative arthritis.

TI  - Functional outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery
PY  - 2019
AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the most common sports injuries with a reported yearly incidence rate of over two million injuries worldwide. The main aim of this thesis is to investigate various aspects related to the functional outcomes of ACLR through a series of clinical studies. Ethical approval was sought and granted by the North of Scotland Research Ethics Service. A systematic review was conducted to investigate the outcome measures used in Level I and II clinical ACLR studies. The review showed wide variability in the outcome measures utilised with no consensus on the ideal outcome instrument or combination of instruments to report the outcome of ACLR. Five-year results from the UK National Ligament Registry (NLR) were analysed with review for limitations of registry data and future recommendations. The data analysed provided a comprehensive review for the demographics, surgical techniques and functional outcomes of ACLR surgery across the UK. NLR data is limited by multiple factors including high rate of incomplete data, duplication of data, poor patient compliance and lack of validation of the data. A study was conducted to examine the hypothesis that patients with ACLR do not return to their pre-injury functional status at two years postoperatively. The study showed significant improvement in patient symptoms postoperatively compare to their post-injury scores, but the majority of patients failed to achieve their pre-injury functional outcome scores at 2 years postoperatively. In a comparative study, the anteromedial portal (AM) technique in femoral tunnel drilling was compared with the trans-tibial (TT) technique with respect to radiological and functional outcomes. The hypothesis was that AM portal produces better functional outcomes compared with TT technique. We found that the AM portal achieved a more anatomical position of the graft but there was no difference between the two techniques in functional outcome at 2 years postoperatively. However, ACLR with the AM portal technique had higher graft failure rate compared with the TT technique. The medium- term outcome of all-inside meniscal repairs was investigated in a longitudinal study. Meniscal repairs with concomitant ACLR had a lower failure rate compared with isolated meniscal repairs. This indicates that surgeons should have a low threshold for repairing meniscal tear during ACLR surgery. The healing response technique was studied in a selected group of patients with complete proximal ACL tears. This technique yielded good functional outcome for most of the patients at 2 years postoperative follow up. The studies included in this thesis provides substantial information for surgeons treating patients with ACL injuries. It provides a platform for further research studies investigating the outcomes of ACLR surgery.

TI  - Histological properties of autogenous hamstring grafts after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
PY  - 2018
AB  - Objective To investigate the histological characteristics of autogenous hamstring grafts after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Methods The patients who underwent arthroscopic single-bundle ACL reconstruction with autogenous hamstring tendons and were followed up at least 4 years and also underwent second-look arthroscopy between March 2017 and December 2017 and met the selection criteria were considered for enrollment. Graft quality under arthroscopy was evaluated as good remodeling group (GRG, the total scores were 4-6) and poor remodeling group (PRG, the total scores were 1-3) according to synovial and vascular coverage, the apparent tension of the grafts, the thickness and retear of the grafts. During the second-look arthroscopic procedures, ACL graft biopsies were performed. Normal ACL tissues harvested from the patients under 60 years old who underwent total knee arthroplasty were designated as normal controls. Graft vascularity, cellular morphology, cellular metabolism, and collagen fibril distribution were analyzed. Results The 18 specimens (11 cases of GRG group and 7 cases of PRG group) and 9 native ACL biopsied tissue sample were enrolled into the study. Arthroscopy scores were 2-6 (mean, 4.7). The biology under light microscopy of GRG group was similar to that of native ACL in control group. There was no significant difference in the scores of graft vascularity and cellular morphology between GRG group and control group ( P>0.05), while PRG group was significantly lower than the other two groups ( P 0.05), while collagen fibril distribution score of GRG group was significantly lower than that of control group ( P Conclusion While good remodeling grafts under arthroscopy in histological maturation period was proved to be more similar to normal ACL on ultrastructure properties under light and electron microscope, ultra structural differences regarding collagen fibril distribution still persist.

TI  - Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Comparison of Transportal Versus Transtibial Femoral Tunnel Placement
PY  - 2014
AB  - Background and Objectives: Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) tear is one of the most common sport injuries of the knee and arthroscopic reconstruction by bone drilling and graft placement is the accepted treatment. The aim of this study was to compare the results of two different techniques of ACL reconstruction namely transportal (anatomic) and transtibial (non-anatomic) femoral tunnel drilling. Material and Methods: In a comparative clinical study, 60 ACL-deficient patients were operated using transportal ACL reconstruction and compared with another 60 patients treated with transtibial technique. They were compared in terms of performance and ligament stability. Results: Our results showed that comparing the two groups, there were no differences in terms of Lysholm score (transtibial: 96.2 versus transportal: 97.2), post-operative Tegner score (transtibial: 6.3 versus transportal: 6.6) and knee range of motion but IKDC score was significantly better in the transportal group (p<0.001). Conclusion: Anatomic transportal ACL reconstruction technique yields superior results in terms of knee ligament stability comparing to non-anatomic transtibial femoral tunnel drilling.

TI  - Functional Outcomes of Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Versus Quadrupled Semitendinosus and Gracilis Autografts for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.
PY  - 2024
AB  - Introduction Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with autografts has been available for decades; however, the choice of graft is still debated. Here, we compared the functional outcomes of the two most widely used autografts, bone-patella tendon-bone (BPTB) and quadruple-stranded semitendinosus/gracilis (ST/G) autografts, at six months following ACLR. Materials and methods This prospective study was performed in the Department of Orthopedics of Yenepoya Medical College and Hospital located in Mangalore, Karnataka, India, a tertiary care institute over a period of 18 months (November 2018 to April 2020). The study included 38 adult patients who underwent ACLR and were randomly divided into two groups: BPTB autograft (n=19) or ST/G autograft (N=19). The patients were followed up at one-, three-, and six months. Postoperatively, surgical morbidity, knee stability functional outcome on Lysholm score, and knee range of motion (ROM) were assessed. Results The groups were homogenous and comparable regarding age, sex, side of ACL affected, duration of tear to treatment, and muscle wasting (all p-values > 0.05). At six months, the majority of the patients had a tibial translation of 0-2 mm on the Lachman test and anterior drawer test, and the groups did not differ significantly (both p-values > 0.05). Additionally, at six months, both groups demonstrated a significant increase in mean Lysholm score and mean ROM (both p-values < 0.001). However, the groups did not differ in mean Lysholm score and mean ROM at baseline and any of the follow-up visits (all p-values > 0.05). Conclusion At six months, ACLR with BPTB and ST/G autografts produced significant and comparable knee stability, functional outcome, and ROM.

TI  - Risk factors of cartilage lesion after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament injury is the most common sports injury in orthopaedics, which can adversely affect knee joint function and exercise of patients. Using arthroscopy to reconstruct the anterior cruciate ligament has become the first choice for treating anterior cruciate ligament rupture. However, different degrees of articular cartilage injury of the knee can be observed in patients after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. More importantly, the articular cartilage injury after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction indicates that it will develop into osteoarthritis in the long term. It is of great significance to fully understand the factors that lead to the occurrence and development of cartilage injury. This article reviews the effects of surgical methods, meniscus status, different grafts, time from injury to surgical intervention, postoperative knee joint stability, postoperative rehabilitation, knee joint anatomical factors, and demographic characteristics of patients on articular cartilage degeneration after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The present review provides insights into the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, which can be used to investigate new treatment strategies to delay and prevent the progress of osteoarthritis. At the same time, it provides a holistic understanding of the influence of multiple factors on cartilage lesions after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

TI  - Failure of anterior cruciate ligament surgery
PY  - 2008
AB  - present study classifies and describes the multifactorial causes of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) surgery failure, with a view to preventing and resolving such situations. The study particularly focuses on those causes that require ACL replacement due to recurrent instability, without neglecting those that affect function or pro- duce persistent pain. It is often possible to identify a primary or secondary cause of ACL surgery failure, and even the most meticu- lous planning can give rise to unexpected findings during the intervention. The adopted protocol therefore should be sufficiently flexible to adapt to the course of surgery. Preoperative patient counseling is essential, li- miting his or her expectations as to the results of surgery, in view of the complexity of this kind of procedure. With adequate preoperative planning, close attention to details, and appropriate definition of the patient ex- pectations ACL revision surgery may offer beneficial and satisfactory results for the patient.

PY  - 2015
AB  - Background:One of the well-studied epidemiological phenomena of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries is the 2- to 9-fold increase in the relative risk of ACL rupture in female athletes compared with male athletes. However, the influence of patient sex on the outcome after ACL reconstruction remains unclear, with some authors reporting inferior outcomes in females and others noting no significant difference.Purpose:To provide a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the possible association between patient sex and the subjective and objective outcomes after ACL reconstruction.Methods:This study was conducted according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. All studies that reported clinical outcomes after ACL reconstruction in males and females independently were included in the review. A quantitative random-effects meta-analysis was performed to compare outcomes between sexes. For outcomes with considerable heterogeneity, meta-...

TI  - No Difference in Knee Function or Prevalence of Osteoarthritis after Reconstruction of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament with 4-Strand Hamstring Autograft versus Patellar Tendon—Bone Autograft: A Randomized Study with 10-Year Follow-up
PY  - 2010
AB  - BackgroundThe choice of different graft types and surgical techniques used when reconstructing a torn anterior cruciate ligament may influence the long-term prevalence of osteoarthritis and functional outcomes.HypothesisThere are no differences in the prevalence of knee osteoarthritis or knee function in patients undergoing reconstruction of a torn anterior cruciate ligament with 4-strand hamstring autograft versus patellar tendon—bone autograft.Study DesignRandomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.MethodsSeventy-two patients with subacute or chronic rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament were randomly assigned to autograft reconstruction with 4-strand gracilis and semitendinosus tendon (HAM) (N = 37) or with patellar tendon—bone (PTB) (N = 35) from the ipsilateral side. Outcome measurements were the Cincinnati knee score, single-legged hop tests, isokinetic muscle strength tests, pain, knee joint laxity test (KT-1000 arthrometer), and a radiologic evaluation (Kellgren and Lawrence) at 10-year ...

TI  - Comparison of Knee Pain and Difficulty With Kneeling Between Patellar Tendon and Hamstring Tendon Autografts After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Study From the New Zealand ACL Registry.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND">The bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) autograft is associated with difficulty with kneeling after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction; however, it is unclear whether it results in a more painful or symptomatic knee compared with the hamstring tendon autograft.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE">To identify the rate and risk factors for knee pain and difficulty with kneeling after ACL reconstruction.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN">Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS">Primary ACL reconstruction procedures prospectively recorded in the New Zealand ACL Registry from April 2014 to May 2021 were analyzed. The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) was used to identify patients reporting consequential knee pain (CKP), defined as a KOOS Pain subscore of ≤72 points, and severe kneeling difficulty (SKD), defined as a self-report of "severe" or "extreme" difficulty with kneeling. Absolute values of the KOOS Pain and Symptoms subscales were also compared.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">A total of 10,999 patients were analyzed. At 2-year follow-up, 9.3% (420/4492) reported CKP, and 12.0% (537/4471) reported SKD. The most important predictor of CKP at 2-year follow-up was having significant pain before surgery (adjusted odds ratio, 4.10; <i>P</i> &lt; .001). The most important predictor of SKD at 2-year follow-up was the use of a BTB autograft rather than a hamstring tendon autograft (21.3% vs 9.4%, respectively; adjusted odds ratio, 3.12; <i>P</i> &lt; .001). There was no difference between the BTB and hamstring tendon grafts in terms of CKP (9.9% vs 9.2%, respectively; <i>P</i> = .494) or in absolute values of the KOOS Pain (mean, 88.7 vs 89.0, respectively; <i>P</i> = .37) and KOOS Symptoms (mean, 82.5 vs 82.1, respectively; <i>P</i> = .49) subscales.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION">At 2-year follow-up after primary ACL reconstruction, 9.3% of patients reported CKP, and 12.0% reported SKD. The BTB autograft was associated with difficulty with kneeling, but it did not result in a more painful or symptomatic knee compared with the hamstring tendon autograft.</AbstractText>

TI  - Knee surgery: Trends and the 50 most cited articles
PY  - 2019
AB  - Knee Surgery is one of the most commonly performed orthopedic procedures, and a rapidly evolving area of research. A bibliographic analysis was conducted to explore the characteristics of the top 50 most cited articles in knee surgery. The Web of Science Core Collection Database was used to search for Knee AND Surgery, further refined for orthopedic surgery, yielding 1,660 articles. After inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, the top 50 cited articles were statistically and thematically analyzed. Year of publication ranged from 1982 to 2014. The highest volume of research came from USA, with the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery having the highest number of papers in the top 50. The most common theme of research was Knee Arthroplasty Outcomes. Our study elucidates trends and popular areas of research in the field of knee surgery, and provides researchers with an overview of areas to focus, where there is scope for high-impact original research.

TI  - Posterior single-incision semitendinosus harvest for a quadrupled anterior cruciate ligament graft construct: determination of graft length and diameter based on patient sex, height, weight, and body mass index.
PY  - 2014
AB  - Purpose This study aimed to determine final graft length and diameter for a quadrupled semitendinosus anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) construct harvested from a single-incision posterior approach with correlation to preoperative patient variables of sex, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI). Methods This was a retrospective review of data collected prospectively on 60 patients undergoing all-inside quadrupled semitendinosus autograft ACL reconstruction. Results The mean values of the final quadrupled constructs were a length of 70.3 mm and a diameter of 9.0 mm. Separated based on sex, female versus male final mean graft length was 68.1 mm versus 71.7 mm, and final mean graft diameter was 8.6 mm and 9.3 mm, respectively. In both sexes, patient height and weight were strongly correlated to final construct diameter ( r  = 0.60 and r  = 0.56) and length ( r  = 0.47 and r  = 0.44), respectively. Conclusions A single-incision posterior harvest approach allowed for retrieval of semitendinosis tendon autografts of sufficient dimension to allow for construction of quadrupled ACL grafts of a diameter of 8 mm or more in 95% of cases. In addition, desired graft length was achieved in all cases. Graft dimensions had moderately strong direct correlations to patient height and weight, with significant size differences noted between the sexes. We believe this to be helpful data for surgeons who might consider performing a quadrupled semitendinosus autograft ACL reconstruction. Level of Evidence Level IV, therapeutic case series.

TI  - No Difference in Outcome of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with “Bone-patellar Tendon-bone versus Semitendinosus-gracilis Graft with Preserved Insertion”: A Randomized Clinical Trial
PY  - 2019
AB  - The type of graft for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is still a topic of debate and there is still no clear consensus on the ideal graft for ACL reconstruction. This study was conducted to compare the outcome of ACL reconstruction surgery between hamstring tendon graft and bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) graft. One hundred and sixty professional athletes were enrolled in the study. They were divided into two groups by computerized randomization. In Group I, ACL reconstruction was done using BPTB graft, and in Group II, ACL reconstruction was done using semitendinosus gracilis graft with preserved tibial insertion (STGPI). Postoperatively, patients were assessed for knee stability, Lysholm score, and WOMAC score. Mean KT-1000 side-to-side difference at 1 year was 2.31 ± 1.68 mm in BPTB cohort and 2.52 ± 1.6 mm in STGPI cohort (P = 0.4); and at 2 years, it was 1.98 ± 1.62 mm in BPTB cohort and 2.23 ± 1.6 mm in STGPI cohort (P = 0.4). Mean Lysholm score at 2 years was 96.1 ± 5.81 in STGPI cohort and 97.3 ± 4.62 in BPTB cohort (P = 0.15). Mean WOMAC score at 2 years was 3.3 ± 2.76 in STGPI cohort and 2.84 ± 2.21 in BPTB cohort (P = 0.25). Graft rupture rate was 3.75%; 3 patients in each group had graft rupture. Kneeling pain was present in 15% (12/80) of patients with BPTB graft whereas none of the patients in STGPI cohort had kneeling pain. There was no difference between two grafts in term of knee stability, visual analog scale score and functional outcome. However, hamstring tendon graft is associated with less donor site morbidity.

TI  - Ten year follow-up study comparing conservative versus operative treatment of anterior cruciate ligament ruptures. A matched-pair analysis of high level athletes
PY  - 2008
AB  - Objective: To compare long term outcome of highly active patients with anterior cruciate ligament ruptures treated operatively versus non-operatively. Design: We reviewed high level athletes with an anterior cruciate ligament rupture on either MRI or arthroscopic evaluation more than 10 years previously, who were treated conservatively. They were pair-matched with patients who had had an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with bone-patella-tendon-bone, with respect to age, gender and Tegner activity score before injury. Participants: In total 50 patients were pair-matched. Results: We found no statistical difference between the patients treated conservatively or operatively with respect to osteoarthritis or meniscal lesions of the knee, as well as activity level, objective and subjective functional outcome. The patients who were treated operatively had a significantly better stability of the knee at examination. Conclusion: We conclude that the instability repair using a bone-patella-tendon-bone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is a good knee stabilising operation. Both treatment options however show similar patient outcome at 10 year follow up.

TI  - Isolierte und kombinierte Verletzungen des vorderen Kreuzbands
PY  - 2008
AB  - Die Ruptur des vorderen Kreuzbands (VKB) stellt eine schwere Kniegelenkverletzung mit hohen Behandlungs- und Folgekosten dar. Ein oft in den Hintergrund tretender Aspekt ihrer Therapie ist das korrekte zeitliche Management, das jedoch das Behandlungsergebnis unmittelbar beeinflusst. Laut Literatur sollte die chirurgische Therapie isolierter VKB-Verletzungen mittels Ersatzplastik im Intervall nach Abschwellen bei reizfreiem Kniegelenk mit freier Beweglichkeit erfolgen. In Ausnahmefallen ist u. E. auch eine unfallzeitpunktnahe Versorgung innerhalb der ersten 2 Tage nach dem Trauma moglich. Typischerweise bestehen Begleitverletzungen. Basisnahe Meniskusverletzungen erfordern ein zeitnahes operatives Handeln, parallel bestehende Seitenbandverletzungen sollten konsequent konservativ behandelt, Verletzungen des Knorpels und subchondralen Knochens bereits in der Akutphase mitberucksichtigt werden. Eine Besonderheit stellen Kombinationsverletzungen aus vorderem und hinterem Kreuzband dar, die therapeutisch und diagnostisch anspruchsvoll sind. Es wird das Vorgehen bei isolierten VKB-Rupturen und den typischen Begleitverletzungen dargestellt. Nur unter Berucksichtigung Letzterer lassen sich zuverlassig gute Ergebnisse auch bei schwierigen Konstellationen erreichen.

TI  - ACL Reconstruction: Chondroprotective Effects, Risks of Reinjury
PY  - 2012
AB  - This chapter discusses long-term data from ACL reconstruction studies, the factors that are most likely related to increased risk of developing arthritis, and causes of failure of surgery. While data from most ACL reconstruction studies show favorable results in terms of improved knee stability and function, the outcome in terms of prevalence of osteoarthritis in long-term studies is highly variable. Factors that may cause eventual knee arthritis include meniscectomy, abnormal knee kinematics, severe bone bruising, damage to other knee ligament structures, alteration in the biochemical environment, chondral fractures or lesions, excessive uncorrected varus or valgus lower limb malalignment, obesity, familial predisposition, and long-term participation in high impact sports activities. The problem exists that ACL reconstruction does not fully restore normal knee kinematics, despite advanced surgical procedures and rehabilitation. The published rates of either reinjuring an ACL-reconstructed knee or sustaining an ACL rupture on the contralateral knee upon return to activities after surgery vary widely from 3 to 40 %.

TI  - An institution-specific analysis of ACL reconstruction failure.
PY  - 2011
AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study was to determine the most common causes of failed anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) using modern reconstructive techniques at a single, high-volume institution. In addition, the clinical outcomes of patients undergoing revision ACLR will be reported. The surgical logs of four senior knee surgeons were retrospectively reviewed for all patients who had undergone ACLR between 2002 and 2009. Patients were excluded if they did not have both the primary and revision surgery on the same knee with the same surgeon. Out of 1944 ACL reconstructions, 28 patients (56 reconstructions) were included in the study. Radiographic studies, operative reports, KT-1000 scores, and chart notes were used to identify all potential factors that may have led to failure. All patients were invited to return for a follow-up examination and survey. Of the 28 patients, the mean age at the index and revision procedure was 22 +/- 11 (range, 12 to 50) and 24 +/- 11 (range, 14 to 57), respectively. In 20 cases, the cause of failure was determined to be acute trauma (sports, work, or accident); in 1 case, the cause was biologic failure; while in 7 cases, the cause was technical error. During the study period the surgeons performed a combined total of 1944 procedures, for an overall failure rate of 1.8%. Twenty patients (71%) were available for follow-up at a mean 30.2 +/- 17.7 months. The overall postrevision outcomes were good to excellent for a majority of patients, with an average Lysholm score of 84 +/- 15.5 and International Knee Documentation Committee score of 77.2 +/- 13.8. The pre- and postoperative KT-1000 scores were 12.1 +/- 2.8 and 6.7 +/- 2.8, respectively. The results from this study suggest that traumatic re-injury, and not surgical/surgeon error, is the most common cause of ACLR failure using anatomic reconstructive principles and strong fixation. In addition, good to excellent outcomes following revision ACLR can be expected in the majority of patients.

TI  - Which determinants predict tibiofemoral and patellofemoral osteoarthritis after anterior cruciate ligament injury? A systematic review
PY  - 2015
AB  - Background Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is an important risk factor for development of knee osteoarthritis (OA). To identify those ACL injured patients at increased risk for knee OA, it is necessary to understand risk factors for OA. Aim To summarise the evidence for determinants of (1) tibiofemoral OA and (2) patellofemoral OA in ACL injured patients. Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and CINAHL databases were searched up to 20 December 2013. Additionally, reference lists of eligible studies were manually and independently screened by two reviewers. 2348 studies were assessed for the following main inclusion criteria: ≥20 patients; ACL injured patients treated operatively or non-operatively; reporting OA as outcome; description of relationship between OA outcome and determinants; and a follow-up period ≥2 years. Two reviewers extracted the data, assessed the risk of bias and performed a best-evidence synthesis. Results Sixty-four publications were included and assessed for quality. Two studies were classified as low risk of bias. Medial meniscal injury/meniscectomy showed moderate evidence for influencing OA development (tibiofemoral OA and compartment unspecified). Lateral meniscal injury/meniscectomy showed moderate evidence for no relationship (compartment unspecified), as did time between injury and reconstruction (tibiofemoral and patellofemoral OA). Conclusions Medial meniscal injury/meniscectomy after ACL rupture increased the risk of OA development. In contrast, it seems that lateral meniscal injury/meniscectomy has no relationship with OA development. Our results suggest that time between injury and reconstruction does not influence patellofemoral and tibiofemoral OA development. Many determinants showed conflicting and limited evidence and no determinant showed strong evidence.

PY  - 2011
AB  - Background: There are still controversies about graft selection for primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Prospective, randomized long-term studies are needed to determine the differences between the graft materials.Hypothesis: Eleven years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction there is no difference in functional outcome and quality of life between patients with patellar tendon or hamstring tendon autografts; however, the patients with patellar tendon autograft would have a higher prevalence of osteoarthritis.Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.Methods: From June 1999 to March 2000, 64 patients were included in this prospective study. A single surgeon performed primary arthroscopically assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in an alternating sequence.

TI  - Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: Autogenous Quadriceps Tendon–Bone Compared With Bone–Patellar Tendon–Bone Grafts at 2-Year Follow-up
PY  - 2008
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare postoperative anterior knee pain, knee stability, and functional scores of an autogenous bone–patellar tendon–bone (BPTB) graft and a quadriceps tendon–bone (QTB) graft. Methods A total of 48 patients—27 who had anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction by use of an autogenous BPTB graft and 21 who had ACL reconstruction by use of a QTB graft—were assessed at a minimum follow-up of 24 months after surgery. An accelerated rehabilitation program was adapted, and the rehabilitation protocol was identical for both groups. Results The mean side-to-side difference as measured with a KT-2000 arthrometer (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA) was 2.73 mm (SD, 1.45 mm) in the BPTB group and 2.79 mm (SD, 1.32 mm) in the QTB group ( P = .880). Postoperatively, the International Knee Documentation Committee score was grade A or B in 23 patients (85.2%) in the BPTB group and 18 (85.7%) in the QTB group ( P = .997). The mean anterior knee pain score was 86.9 in the BPTB group as compared with 90.2 in the QTB group ( P = .107). In a kneeling posture, 13 BPTB patients reported discomfort (moderate in 10 and severe in 3) whereas only 4 QTB patients had moderate discomfort ( P = .029). No significant differences were found with regard to other activities surveyed. Conclusions A QTB graft attached with the EndoPearl device (Linvatec, Largo, FL) appears to be an effective alternative for single-bundle ACL reconstruction. When followed with an accelerated rehabilitation program, reconstruction with a QTB graft provided knee stability comparable to a BPTB graft but with less kneeling pain than a BPTB graft. Level of Evidence Level III, retrospective comparative study.

TI  - Second-Look Arthroscopic Evaluation and Clinical Outcomes of Anatomic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with Autograft and Hybrid Graft: A Retrospective Study.
PY  - 2017
AB  - BACKGROUND Graft choice is very controversial. This study compared the second-look evaluation and clinical outcomes of anatomic ACL-R using a thin autograft versus a thick hybrid graft. MATERIAL AND METHODS Sixty-eight patients who had received ACL-R with hamstring autograft or autograft-allograft hybrid graft accepted second-look arthroscopy were grouped (autograft: n=31, age: 32.8±8.9, Male/Female: 16/15, and hybrid graft: n=37, age: 33.9±8.4, Male/Female: 27/10). Patients were evaluated with the functional score and KT-1000 test before reconstruction. The re-examination and second-look evaluation were performed at 2-year follow-up. Results were compared and further comparisons were made for grafts size >8.5 mm. RESULTS The hybrid group showed thicker graft size and bigger graft occupancy (9.0±0.5 mm vs. 8.5±0.7 mm, P=.003; 80.1±7.0% vs. 69.9±6.9%, P8.5 mm were selected and compared (autograft, n=16; hybrid, n=29). Graft tension and Synovial coverage showed a significant difference (P=.036 and P=.029). The Lysholm, IKDC, and KT-1000 test were significantly superior for the autograft than the hybrid graft (P=.036, P=.004, and P=.003, respectively). CONCLUSIONS A pure autograft is superior to a hybrid graft with same diameter in ACL-R because the augmenting allografts may be null and void. Therefore, a homogenous graft is recommended.

TI  - An interference screw made using a silk fibroin-based bulk material with high content of hydroxyapatite for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in a rabbit model.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Upgradation is still in need for the clinically applied interference screws in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction for more reliable fixation. Silk fibroin bulk materials offer a promising opportunity for this application except lacking osteoinductivity to some extent. Here we report a novel silk-based bulk material with high content of hydroxyapatite-silk fibroin (HA-SF) hybrid particles, which is prepared via a dual-network hydrogel. This composite bulk material possesses a compression modulus of 3.2 GPa, comparable to that of the natural compact bone, and presents satisfactory cytocompatibility and osteoinductivity in vitro when combined with the HA-SF nanoparticles particularly. This composite bulk material shaped into interference screws exhibits remarkable biomechanical properties and significant new-bone ingrowth in the host bone tunnel in a rabbit anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) model at 4 weeks and 12 weeks post-operatively. Moreover, considering that this "hydrogel method" allows the material to be formed in a mold, avoiding complicated post fabrication, it is a potential candidate for clinical translation.

TI  - Surgical and Biomechanical Perspectives on Osteoarthritis and the ACL Deficient Knee: A Critical Review of the Literature
PY  - 2013
AB  - This review was undertaken to better understand the debate regarding the issue of osteoarthritis associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, from a surgical and biomechanical standpoint. Much of the current debate focuses on contributory surgical factors and their relative roles in increasing or decreasing the risk of future osteoarthritis development, primarily highlighting the controversy over whether reconstructive surgery itself is necessarily protective. This review addresses the evolution of ACL reconstruction techniques over time, and with a view to thoroughly examine the role of surgery, outcome differences in procedural technique are reviewed, with a focus on open versus arthroscopic methods, graft choice and the use of a double versus single bundle reconstruction technique.

Moreover, other potentially important contributory factors are identified and discussed, such as intrinsic biomechanical alterations sustained at the time of initial injury, and how these may have a more significant role with regard to future osteoarthritic changes in the knee than previously attributed.

TI  - Quadrupled Hamstring Graft Diameter Adequacy in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Patient Anthropometry: A Prospective Cohort Study in Indian Males.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Background and aim The diameter of the graft used for the reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is an important determinant for the overall strength and future outcome of the operative procedure. Preoperative prediction of quadrupled hamstrings autograft (QHAG) diameter can prove to be of help in forecasting the need for augmentation or alternative grafts like quadriceps, bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft, and synthetic grafts. The relationship between the preoperatively assessed anthropometric parameters and the obtained quadrupled hamstrings graft diameter has not been extensively studied, especially in the population of Indian origin. This study aimed at investigating whether a correlation exists between the measured anthropometric parameters like age, weight, height, thigh circumference, and body mass index (BMI) and the intraoperatively obtained diameter of hamstring graft for ACL reconstruction in the study population of Indian male subjects. Study design A prospective cohort study conducted in a tertiary care center and teaching hospital in a district in central Uttar Pradesh, India. Methods The preoperative anthropometric data (age, height, weight, BMI, and thigh circumference of the injured side) of 73 Indian male subjects undergoing primary ACL reconstructive surgeries between May 2018 and August 2020 were prospectively collected, and their respective intraoperative QHAG diameters measured and recorded. Pearson's correlation test was employed to determine the correlation between the preoperative demographic and anthropometric data and the obtained corresponding graft diameters. Simple linear regression was performed to obtain the graphical plots and determine the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. Of these, the variables showing significant association were subjected to stepwise linear regression to identify and exclude the confounder(s) and obtain the predicted equation. Results The study comprised 73 male participants. The study participants' mean age was found to be 33.7 years, mean height was 173.1 cm, mean weight was 71.2 kg, mean BMI was 23.7 kg/m2, mean thigh circumference was 50.4 cm, and the obtained mean graft diameter was 8.0 mm. A strongly positive correlation was observed between height and the graft diameter (r=0.940, P=0.000) and thigh circumference and the graft diameter (r=0.769, P=0.000). In contrast, weight showed a moderately positive correlation with the graft diameter (r=0.514, P=0.000). A very weakly positive correlation was observed between the BMI of the subjects and the obtained graft diameters (r=0.236, P=0.045). However, no correlation was observed between the age and the final graft diameters (r=0.140, P=0.238). Subsequent linear regression analysis indicates that only height (R2=0.883, P=0.000; strong) and the thigh circumference (R2=0.591, P=0.000; moderate) share a significant predictive value for the obtained QHAG. Both height and thigh circumference together were good predictors for graft diameter as determined by multiple regression (F (2,70)=272.372, P<0.001), with an R2 of 0.886. Conclusion Certain anthropometric parameters depict a positive correlation with the QHAG diameter and can assist in preoperative planning, predicting the possible harvested graft diameter and the need for alternative grafts or augmentation during ACL reconstructive surgeries.

TI  - Validated Pediatric Functional Outcomes of All-epiphyseal ACL Reconstructions: Does Reinjury Affect Outcomes?
PY  - 2018
AB  - Background Greater frequency and intensity level of sports participation may be contributing to an increasing incidence of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears in skeletally immature athletes. Prior studies have assessed the functional outcomes of physeal-respecting ACL reconstruction in this patient population based on adult functional outcomes scoring systems; however, there is only sparse literature evaluating functional outcomes of this specific patient population. This study aimed to retrospectively evaluate a cohort of pediatric patients who had undergone all-epiphyseal ACL reconstruction (AEACLR) with a set of clinically validated, pediatric-specific patient-reported functional outcomes scores (PRFOS). We hypothesized that patients who had rerupture would have significantly lower outcomes scores compared with those who did not rerupture. Methods This was a retrospective evaluation of AEACLR patients at a single, tertiary care, children's hospital within a period of 2 years and had >6 months of initial clinical postoperative follow-up. Those who consented to participation were provided an online combined survey including questions relating to demographics and rerupture as well as 3 validated pediatric PRFOS. Statistical analysis of the cohort demographics, PRFOS, and subgroup analysis of the rerupture group compared with the ACL intact patients was performed. Results The mean functional outcome scores at a mean of 48.6 months from surgery demonstrated excellent return to functional activity (Mean International Knee Documentation Committee, 93.8; Pedi-Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System, 98.8; Pedi- Functional Activity Brief Score, 21.6). There was a 13% rerupture rate and rerupture patients had a significantly decreased Pedi-International Knee Documentation Committee (94.9 intact vs. 86.0 rerupture; P=0.001) and Pedi-Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (99.4 intact vs. 95.4 rupture; P=0.001) scores. Conclusions AEACLR patients have excellent outcomes based on pediatric-specific PRFOS. Rerupture patients demonstrated a decrease in functional outcomes scores compared with intact ACL patients. The results demonstrate the efficacy of AEACLR as measured by pediatric-specific functional outcome scores for the treatment of ACL rupture in skeletally immature athletes. Level of evidence Level III-retrospective comparative study.

TI  - Recent Advances in the Rehabilitation of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries
PY  - 2012
AB  - Synopsis Rehabilitation following anterior cruciate ligament surgery continues to change, with the current emphasis being on immediate weight bearing and range of motion, and progressive muscular strengthening, proprioception, dynamic stability, and neuromuscular control drills. The rehabilitation program should be based on scientific and clinical research and focus on specific drills and exercises designed to return the patient to the desired functional goals. The goal is to return the patient's knee to homeostasis and the patient to his or her sport or activity as safely as possible. Unique rehabilitation techniques and special considerations for the female athlete will also be discussed. The purpose of this article is to provide the reader with a thorough scientific basis for anterior cruciate ligament rehabilitation based on graft selection, patient population, and concomitant injuries.

          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">A total of 71 studies across 13 countries with a total sample size of 629,120 met the inclusion criteria. Fifteen factors were associated with an increase in the risk of revision or rerupture after ACLR: male sex (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.14-1.41), younger age (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.05-1.08), lower body mass index (BMI) (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.00-1.06), family history (OR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.50-4.08), White race (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.08-1.60), higher posterolateral tibial slope (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.05-1.26), preoperative high-grade anterior knee laxity (OR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.46-3.64), higher baseline Marx activity level (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02-1.13), return to a high activity level/sport (OR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.15-3.57), an ACLR within less than a year after injury (OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.81-2.32), a concomitant medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.31-2.00), an anteromedial portal or transportal technique (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.22-1.51), hamstring tendon (HT) autografts (vs bone-patellar tendon-bone [BPTB] autografts) (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.40-1.82), allografts (OR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.65-4.19), and smaller graft diameter (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.05-1.38). The other factors failed to show an association with an increased risk of revision or rerupture after ACLR.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION">Male sex, younger age, lower BMI, family history, White race, higher posterolateral tibial slope, preoperative high-grade anterior knee laxity, higher baseline Marx activity level, return to a high activity level/sport, an ACLR within less than a year from injury, a concomitant MCL injury, an anteromedial portal or transportal technique, HT autografts (vs BPTB autografts), allografts, and smaller graft diameter may increase the risk of revision or rerupture after ACLR. Raising awareness and implementing effective preventions/interventions for risk factors are priorities for clinical practitioners to reduce the incidence of revision or rerupture after ACLR.</AbstractText>

TI  - Osteoarthritic changes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using bone-patellar tendon-bone or hamstring tendon autografts: a retrospective, 7-year radiographic and clinical follow-up study.
PY  - 2008
AB  - Purpose: This study was undertaken to evaluate the long-term radiographic appearance and clinical outcome after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction by use of either bone–patellar tendon–bone (BPTB) or hamstring tendon (HT) autografts and to evaluate how associated meniscal injuries affect the prevalence of osteoarthritis (OA). Methods: ACL reconstruction was performed in 124 consecutive patients. Of these patients, 113 (91%) (72 BPTB and 41 HT) returned for a follow-up examination at a median of 86 months (range, 67 to 111 months) after reconstruction. The patients underwent standard weight-bearing radiographic examinations and clinical evaluation. Results: The radiographic assessments showed no significant differences between the graft types in terms of OA classified according to the Ahlback and Fairbank rating systems. Overall, 23% of the patients had degenerative changes according to the Ahlback system, and 74% had degenerative changes according to the Fairbank system. Associated meniscal injuries increased the prevalence of OA. Clinically, no significant differences were found between the graft types in terms of the Tegner activity test, 1-leg hop test, International Knee Documentation Committee evaluation system, disturbed area of sensitivity, manual Lachman test, KT-1000 laxity test (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA), and knee-walking test. The Lysholm score ( P = .02) and knee-walking ability ( P = .02) were significantly better in the HT group. Conclusions: At a median of 7 years after ACL reconstruction with either BPTB or HT autografts, the prevalence of OA as seen on standard weight-bearing radiographs and the clinical outcome were comparable. The presence of meniscal injuries increased the prevalence of OA. Level of Evidence: Level III, therapeutic, retrospective comparative study.

TI  - All-Inside Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Quadrupled Semitendinosus: Comparable 2-Year Outcomes in Male and Female Patients.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Purpose To determine 2-year functional outcomes using an all-inside quadrupled semitendinosus anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction technique in male and female patients. Methods A total of 100 patients who underwent quadrupled semitendinosus all-inside hamstring ACL reconstruction by a single surgeon were enrolled. Patient-reported outcome scores collected preoperatively and postoperatively included visual analog scale, Veterans Rand 12-Item Health Survey (VR-12; Physical and Mental), Marx Activity Scale, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores (KOOS), and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Results A total of 100 ACL reconstructions comprising 62 female, and 38 male patients were included in this study. Mean graft diameter was 9.4 mm in female and 9.8 mm in male patients (range, 9-11). Outcome scores demonstrated improvement from preoperative to 2-year postoperative respectively: visual analog scale pain 3.18, 1.07, VR-12 physical 36.35, 52.64, VR-12 mental 53.96, 54.65, KOOS pain 59.17, 89.03, KOOS symptoms 52.64, 80.79, KOOS Activities of Daily Living 69.38, 95.4, KOOS Sport 28.97, 81.25, KOOS Quality of Life 27.54, 71.56, WOMAC Pain 71.56, 92.65, WOMAC Stiffness 60.55, 84.13, and WOMAC Function 69.38, 95.4. Marx activity score decreased from baseline (10.98) to 2 years’ postoperatively (8.75). At 2 years, patient expectations were met or exceeded with regards to pain (94%), motion and strength (91%), normal function of daily living (95%), and return to sport (79%). Conclusions Anatomic all-inside quadrupled semitendinosus ACL reconstruction improves functional outcomes similarly to previous studies between baseline and clinical follow-up at 1-year and 2-years postoperatively and is comparable in both male and female patients. Level of Evidence Level III, retrospective comparative study.

TI  - Effect of Anteromedial Portal Entrance Drilling Angle during Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Three-Dimensional Computer Simulation
PY  - 2014
AB  - Purpose: The object of this study was to evaluate entrance angle effects on femoral tunnel length and cartilage damage during anteromedial portal drilling using threedimensional computer simulation. Materials and Methods: Data was obtained from an anatomic study performed using 16 cadaveric knees. The anterior cruciate ligament femoral insertion was dissected and the knees were scanned by computer tomography. Tunnels with different of three-dimensional entrance angles were identified using a computer simulation. The effects of different entrance angles on the femoral tunnel length and medial femoral cartilage damage were evaluated. Specifi cally, tunnel length and distance from the medial femoral condyle to a virtual cylinder of the femoral tunnel were measured. Results: In tunnels drilled at a coronal angle of 45°, an axial angle of 45°, and a sagittal angle of 45°, the mean femoral tunnel length was 39.5±3.7 mm and the distance between the virtual cylinder of the femoral tunnel and the medial femoral condyle was 9.4±2.6 mm. The tunnel length at a coronal angle of 30°, an axial angle of 60°, and a sagittal angle of 45°, was 34.0±2.9 mm and the distance between the virtual cylinder of the tunnel and the medial femoral condyle was 0.7±1.3 mm, which was significantly shorter than the standard angle (p<0.001). Conclusion: Extremely low and high entrance angles in both of axial plane and coronal plane produced inappropriate tunnel angles, lengths and higher incidence of cartilage damage. We recommend that angles in proximity to standard angles be chosen during femoral tunnel drilling through the anteromedial portal.

Metodos Foram feitas 110 reconstrucoes do ligamento cruzado anterior com tendao dos flexores e divididas em dois grupos: 1) tecnica com retirada total dos tendoes flexores e 2) tecnica que manteve a insercao tibial desses tendoes. Durante o preparo, dois fragmentos de cada um desses foram enviados para cultura, sendo mensurado o tempo de retirada dos tendoes, do preparo dos tendoes e total da cirurgia. Com 24 horas de pos‐operatorio, foi dosada a proteina C reativa. Seguimento clinico ambulatorial foi realizado de forma protocolada ate 180 dias de pos‐operatorio. Resultados Apesar de terem sido observadas duas infeccoes pos‐operatorias, nao houve contaminacao dos enxertos nem diferenca entre os grupos em relacao ao tempo de preparo dos enxertos e a proteina C reativa com 24 horas de pos‐operatorio. A tecnica classica apresentou maior tempo de retirada do enxerto (p = 0,038) e nao houve diferenca estatistica entre os dois grupos no que tange ao grau de contaminacao e consequente infeccao clinica, embora dois pacientes do grupo 2 tenham tido infeccao com culturas perioperatorias negativas. Conclusao Com base nos resultados obtidos, nao houve associacao entre contaminacao do enxerto com o tempo ou a tecnica de sua preparacao, tampouco entre a contaminacao intraoperatoria e o desenvolvimento de infeccao clinica ou entre alteracao precoce da proteina C reativa e o surgimento de infeccao.

TI  - Abnormal Frontal Plane Knee Mechanics During Sidestep Cutting in Female Soccer Athletes After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction and Return to Sport
PY  - 2013
AB  - Background:Athletes who have undergone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) have a high risk of reinjury upon the return to sports participation. While the mechanisms behind this increased risk of reinjury are unknown, it has been suggested that altered knee biomechanics during sports-specific activities may be a contributing factor.Purpose/Hypothesis:To compare frontal plane knee joint angles and moments during a sidestep cutting maneuver in female soccer athletes who have undergone ACLR with those in athletes with no history of knee injury. It was hypothesized that athletes with a history of ACLR would exhibit increased knee abduction angles and knee adductor moments compared with those with no history of injury.Study Design:Controlled laboratory study.Methods:Twelve female soccer players with a history of ACLR served as the experimental group, and 12 female soccer players with no history of knee injury constituted the control group. Three-dimensional kinematics and ground-reaction forces we...

TI  - Long-term results of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using bone-patellar tendon-bone: an analysis of the factors affecting the development of osteoarthritis.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Purpose To evaluate the clinical outcomes and incidence of knee osteoarthritis (OA) and the factors associated with the onset of OA in the 3 compartments of the knee joint separately after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with bone–patellar tendon–bone autograft. Methods Clinical and radiologic assessments were obtained from 117 patients (80.1%). At follow-up, knee function was evaluated with the Lysholm score, Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) score, Tegner score, and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) 2000 forms. We also evaluated stability and donor-site morbidity. On the follow-up radiographs, OA was assessed by IKDC grading. The factors affecting the onset of OA in the 3 compartments of the knee joint were evaluated. Results The mean follow-up period was 10.3 ± 1.0 years. The mean Lysholm and HSS scores significantly increased at final follow-up ( P P = .005) or sagittal tibial tunnel position (OR, 1.18; P = .02) in the medial compartment and body mass index (BMI) (OR, 1.56; P = .02) in the lateral compartment. Conclusions ACL reconstruction with bone–patellar tendon–bone autograft showed satisfactory clinical results after a mean of 10.3 years. However, pain when walking on hard ground (38.4%) and numbness of the skin (37.6%) were reported. Moreover, the onset of OA appeared in over 40% of the patients. The onset of OA in the medial compartment was correlated with partial meniscectomy and sagittal tibial tunnel position, and the onset of OA in the lateral compartment was correlated with higher BMI. Level of Evidence Level IV, therapeutic case series.

TI  - Bone tunnel enlargement following hamstring anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a comprehensive review
PY  - 2016
AB  - Nowadays, bone tunnel enlargement (BTE) after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is a well-known phenomenon. It has been identified, investigated and described by many authors during the last thirty years. Nevertheless, the etiology of bone tunnel enlargement still remains unclear. It is known that the causes are multifactorial and may include the surgical technique, the method of fixation, materials used, type of graft as well as biological factors. Due to the recent popularization of the use of hamstring grafts in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, the bone tunnel enlargement phenomenon is becoming increasingly common. In this review article, the authors focus on compiling current knowledge about the etiology, diagnosis, and the possibility of reducing the occurrence of this phenomenon by using the latest methods of supporting reconstruction surgery.

TI  - ISOKINETIC MUSCLE PERFORMANCE AFTER ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT RECONSTRUCTION: A CASE-CONTROL STUDY.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Background and Purpose: Knee muscle strength deficits have been reported in individuals who have undergone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Isokinetic testing is a valid way to assess muscle strength. Some isokinetic variables, including the range of motion in the phases to attain a specific velocity, load range (sustained specific velocity), time to achieve deceleration, and qualitative analysis of the torque-angle velocity relationship, may contribute to understanding recovery of these individuals after surgery. Thus, the purpose of this study was to compare the load range (LR), time to attain velocity (TTAV), deceleration time (DT) phases, total range of motion (ROM), peak torque/body mass (PT/BM), angle of peak torque (AngPT) during LR and torque-angle-velocity relationships (TAV3D) between post ACLR and matched control subjects.Study design: Case-control. Methods Seven men who underwent ACLR and seven matched controls were evaluated from four to six months after surgery. Testing was performed on a Biodex System 4 isokinetic dynamometer in concentric mode at 60, 120 and 300 °/s, for knee flexion and extension. Results Statistically significant differences were seen for extension ROM at 60 °/s where ROM was greater in the control group. PT/BM for extensors was also significantly greater in controls by 20 % compared to ACLR at 60 and 120 °/s. PT/BM for flexors was significantly greater for controls at 60 °/s (∼15 %). TAV3D showed differences in torque and, specifically, the control group sustained knee flexion torque for a greater range of motion when compared to the ACLR group. Conclusion The ACL group presented with lower ROM and PT/BM, therefore exhibiting worse muscle performance in comparison to the control group.Level of Evidence: 3.

TI  - Does graft choice affect osteoarthritis development in the knee after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
PY  - 2007
AB  - Dear Editor,

We congratulate your journal and the authors Sajovic et al. on their valuable study [4]. The authors report that good or excellent results can be obtained in the majority of ACL reconstructions using either patellar tendon or hamstring tendon autografts and both grafts provided good subjective outcomes and objective stability with no significant differences between the grafts at 5 years.

ACL reconstructions using either patellar tendon or hamstring tendon autografts are routinely performed all over the world. However, recent studies show that ACL reconstruction, via the use of patellar tendon autograft, causes early osteoarthritis development in the knee, especially if accompanied by meniscal injury [1, 2]. This osteoarthritis develops secondary to a decrease in bone mineral density [3]. That is why, due to decreased harvest-site symptoms and radiographic osteoarthritis, the authors recommend hamstring tendon reconstructions for their patients [1, 2]. In the authors′ study, ACL injury was accompanied by meniscal injury in 39 patient (20 in STG group, 19 in PT group) [4].

Because most patients who have undergone ACL reconstruction are young, we recommend that the surgeon not only considers early complications (patellar fracture, patellar tendon ruptures, anterior knee pain) and midterm differences between graft outcomes, but also considers further complications such as osteoarthritis, which is secondary to patellar tendon autograft. If the surgeon is experienced, STG must be the first choice for ACL reconstruction. We think this information is important to our readers.

The authors also stated, in the Results section, that time from injury to operation was 5 months in patients in the patellar tendon group and 6 months in patients in the STG group. However, in Table 1, time from injury to surgery was 23 months (1–60) for PT and 25 months (1–84) for STG. Which one is true?

TI  - Injury patterns in patients presenting with a recurrent anterior cruciate ligament tear following primary reconstruction
PY  - 2016
AB  - Background: An anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft rupture or a primary ACL injury in the contralateral knee is one of the greatest concerns of patients following primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Our study describes the epidemiology and presence of concomitant meniscal injuries of patients with a graft rupture following primary ACLR or a primary rupture of the contralateral ACL following primary ACLR of the ipsilateral knee.	
 Methods: We reviewed the medical records of 42 patients who underwent a second ACLR. ACLR was performed using the ipsilateral semitendinosus and gracilis autograft. Variables extracted included the presence of concomitant MM and LM injuries intra-operatively, the patients’ level of intensity of sport (light, moderate, strenuous), duration of rehabilitation and mechanism of injury (contact, non-contact).		
 Results: Twenty-four (57.1%) patients had graft rupture of a previously reconstructed ACL of which 20 (83.3%) were male and 18 (42.9%) patients had a primary ACL tear of the contralateral knee following ACLR of the ipsilateral knee of which 18 (100%) were male. Patient who sustained a graft rupture were younger (29.5 vs . 31.9 years), had a higher body mass index (BMI) (26.42 vs . 25.10 kg/m 2 ) and had a longer time before re-injury (6.18 vs . 4.94 years). Concomitant meniscal injury rates were comparable in both groups and the medial meniscus was injured more often.		
 Conclusions: This study describes the demographics of 2 nd ACL injuries in the Asian population. Additional studies that investigate the differences in knee anatomy of Asians and Caucasians and their impact on ACL injuries should be performed.

TI  - Antero-medial portal vs. transtibial techniques for drilling femoral tunnel in ACL reconstruction using 4-strand hamstring tendon: A cross-sectional study with 1-year follow-up
PY  - 2012
AB  - Summary Background: Antero-medial portal (AMP) and trans-tibial (TT) techniques are the most widely used methods for drilling femoral tunnel in ACL reconstructions; yet, debate continues about the preferred method. This study seeks to compare these 2 techniques in patients with ACL tears. Material/Methods: In this comparative study, all cases of isolated ACL reconstruction using 4-strand hamstring tendon in 2006–2010 were evaluated for eligibility. Of 266 patients, 124 cases (60 TT and 64 AMP), with the mean age of 28.48±8.3, met the inclusion criteria. Both groups were compared in 8 follow-ups from the point of view of time of: return to post-surgical activities (including walking without crutches, normal life activity, jogging, and exercising), maximum range of passive movements, knee instability (Lachman test), functional condition (subjective IKDC and Lysholm knee scores), therapeutic outcomes, and patient’s satisfaction with treatment (VAS). Results: AMP technique significantly accelerates patients’ return to activity. AMP patients achieved full

TI  - A systematic review of single-bundle versus double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
PY  - 2011
AB  - Double-bundle (DB) anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is becoming increasingly common. However, no definitive data on the superiority of DB reconstruction have been shown when compared with single-bundle (SB) ACL reconstruction.We performed a comprehensive search of PubMed, Medline, Cochrane, CINAHL and Embase databases using various combinations of keywords such as'ACL','reconstruction','DB' and'SB'. Only articles published in peer-reviewed journals were included in this systematic review.Several new techniques are available for ACL reconstruction. DB ACL reconstruction could provide better outcome for patients in terms of closer restoration of normal knee biomechanics and improving the rotatory laxity of the knee.Data are lacking to allow definitive conclusions on the use of DB reconstruction techniques for routine management of patients with ACL tear.Given the limitations of the current studies, it is not possible to recommend systematic use of DB ACL reconstruction. Even though biomechanical results are encouraging, subjective patient evaluation is similar for SB and DB reconstruction.Studies of higher levels of evidence, for instances large adequately powered randomized trials, should be conducted to bring new insight in this field. With the current evidence available, a simple SB ACL reconstruction is a suitable technique, and it should be not abandoned until stronger scientific evidence in favourof DB ACL reconstruction will be produced.

TI  - Anteromedial versus transtibial tunnel drilling in anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions: a systematic review.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Purpose Failure to anatomically reconstruct the femoral footprint can lead to rotational instability and clinical failure. Thus we sought to compare femoral tunnel drilling techniques, specifically anteromedial (AM) and transtibial (TT) methods, with respect to rotational stability. Methods In this study we evaluated available scientific support for the ability of both techniques to achieve rotational stability of the knee through a systematic review of the literature for directly comparative biomechanical and clinical studies. Results We identified 9 studies (5 clinical Level II or III studies and 4 cadaveric studies) that directly compared AM and TT techniques. Three cadaveric and 2 clinical studies showed superior rotational stability with the AM technique as compared with the TT technique, whereas 2 cadaveric studies and 1 clinical study were unable to show any similar differences. Two studies showed superior clinical outcomes with the AM technique, whereas 3 studies were unable to show any difference. Conclusions In this systematic review of clinical and biomechanical studies directly comparing AM and TT techniques for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) in the literature, there are mixed results, with some studies finding superior rotational stability and clinical outcomes with the AM technique and some finding no difference. No studies showed significantly better results with the TT technique. This study shows that the AM portal technique for ACLR may be more likely to produce improved clinical and biomechanical outcomes but that the TT technique is capable of producing similar outcomes. Level of Evidence Level III, systematic review of Level II and III studies plus cadaver studies.

TI  - Infection After Arthroscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction
PY  - 2014
AB  - Septic arthritis is a rare but potentially devastating complication of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery. The purpose of this study was to provide an evidence-based summarization of the treatment and outcome of infection after ACL reconstruction with a pooled analysis of the reported cases. The authors conducted a systematic review of published studies that evaluated the outcome of septic arthritis after arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. A structured literature review of multiple databases referenced articles from 1950 to 2012. A total of 22,836 knees from 14 published studies were assessed. Postoperative septic arthritis occurred in 121 knees, with a pooled percentage of 0.5%. Mean duration of follow-up after ACL reconstruction was 53.6 months (range, 4-218 months). An average of 1.92 procedures (range, 1-5 procedures) were performed to eradicate the infection. The grafts were retained in 77% of cases. Postoperative intravenous antibiotics were used for at least 5 days (range, 5-90 days) after debridement. At final follow-up, mean postoperative Lysholm score was 80.2 (range, 23-100). No reinfection was observed in 121 patients. This study has helped to further elucidate the outcomes of infection after ACL reconstruction. Once an infection is encountered, culture-specific antibiotics and surgical joint irrigation with graft retention are recommended as initial treatment. Graft removal can be considered only for those infections resistant to initial treatment.

TI  - Comparing Sagittal-Plane Biomechanics of Drop Jump Landing in Athletes With and Without Knee Osteoarthritis 2-Year Post-Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.
PY  - 2024
AB  - The study aimed to determine differences in sagittal-plane joint biomechanics between athletes with and without knee osteoarthritis (OA) during drop vertical jump 2 years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Forty-one athletes with ACLR completed motion analysis testing during drop vertical jump from 30 cm. Sagittal-plane peak joint angles and moments and joint contributions to total support moment (TSM) were calculated during first landing. Medial compartment knee OA of the reconstructed knee was evaluated using Kellgren-Lawrence scores (ACLR group: Kellgren-Lawrence <2; ACLR-OA group: Kellgren-Lawrence ≥2). The ACLR-OA group (n = 13) had higher hip and lower knee contributions in the surgical limb than the ACLR group and their nonsurgical limb. Further, the ACLR-OA group had higher peak hip extension moment than the ACLR group (P = .024). The ACLR-OA group had significantly lower peak knee extension and ankle plantar flexion moments and TSM (P ≤ .032) than ACLR group. The ACLR-OA group landed with increased hip extension moment, decreased knee extension and ankle plantar flexion moments and TSM, and decreased knee and increased hip contributions to TSM compared with ACLR group. The ACLR-OA group may have adopted movement patterns to decrease knee load and compensated by shifting the load to the hip. Clinicians may incorporate tailored rehabilitation programs that mitigate the decreased knee load to minimize the risk of knee OA after ACLR.

TI  - The effect of limb dominance on lower limb functional performance – a systematic review
PY  - 2015
AB  - AbstractLower limb dominance (or lateral preference) could potentially effect functional performance. Clinicians are often asked to make judgements as to when a patient has sufficiently “recovered” from an injury, typically using strength and dynamic performance outcome measures. The primary purpose of this study was to systematically review the literature in relation to limb dominance within active adult populations and discuss some limitations to current methods and relate this to current clinical practice. A search of MEDLINE and CINAHL and EMBASE databases and reference lists of those articles identified was performed. Eleven articles were selected for meta-analysis. There was no statistical effect of limb dominance for any of the functional tests: isokinetic quadriceps and hamstring tests, hamstring:quadriceps ratios, single-leg hop for distance, single-leg vertical jump and vertical ground reaction force following a single-leg vertical jump. Pooled symmetry values varied from 94.6% to 99.6% across t...

TI  - Risk Factors for Contra-Lateral Secondary Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury: A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis
PY  - 2021
AB  - The risk of sustaining a contra-lateral anterior cruciate ligament (C-ACL) injury after primary unilateral ACL injury is high. C-ACL injury often contributes to a further decline in function and quality of life, including failure to return to sport. There is, however, very limited knowledge about which risk factors that contribute to C-ACL injury. To systematically review instrinsic risk factors for sustaining a C-ACL injury. A systematic review with meta-analysis was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Four databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Sport Discus) were searched from inception to January 2020. Inclusion criteria were prospective or retrospective studies investigating any intrinsic risk factor for future C-ACL injury. Meta-analysis was performed and expressed as odds ratios (OR) if two or more articles assessed the same risk factor. 44 moderate-to-high quality studies were eventually included in this review, whereof 35 studies were eligible for meta-analysis, including up to 59 000 individuals. We identified seven factors independently increasing the odds of sustaining a C-ACL injury (in order of highest to lowest OR): (1) returning to a high activity level (OR 3.26, 95% CI 2.10–5.06); (2) Body Mass Index < 25 (OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.73–4.36); (3) age ≤ 18 years (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.51–3.88); (4) family history of ACL injury (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.54–2.80); (5) primary ACL reconstruction performed ≤ 3 months post injury (OR 1.65, 95% CI: 1.32–2.06); (6) female sex (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.14–1.61); and (7) concomitant meniscal injury (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.03–1.42). The following two factors were associated with decreased odds of a subsequent C-ACL injury: 1) decreased intercondylar notch width/width of the distal femur ratio (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.25–0.69) and 2) concomitant cartilage injury (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69–1.00). There were no associations between the odds of sustaining a C-ACL injury and smoking status, pre-injury activity level, playing soccer compared to other sports or timing of return to sport. No studies of neuromuscular function in relation to risk of C-ACL injury were eligible for meta-analysis according to our criteria. This review provides evidence that demographic factors such as female sex, young age (≤ 18 years) and family history of ACL injury, as well as early reconstruction and returning to a high activity level increase the risk of C-ACL injury. Given the lack of studies related to neuromuscular factors that may be modifiable by training, future studies are warranted that investigate the possible role of factors such as dynamic knee stability and alignment, muscle activation and/or strength and proprioception as well as sport-specific training prior to return-to-sport for C-ACL injuries.

TI  - Does Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Lead to Degenerative Disease? Thirteen-Year Results After Bone–Patellar Tendon–Bone Autograft
PY  - 2011
AB  - Background: Reporting of long-term outcome of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with the patellar tendon (bone–patellar tendon–bone [BTB]) autograft is limited. There are concerns that degenerative joint disease is common in the long term, which may be associated with the procedure itself.Hypotheses: (1) ACL reconstruction with BTB provides good long-term outcome. (2) There are additional factors to surgical reconstruction that can be associated with the development of degenerative disease.Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4.Methods: Of 161 patients, 114 were eligible. Patient-centered outcome was by Lysholm and subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score; objective outcome measures were clinical examination and IKDC radiological grade.Results: Mean average follow-up was 13 years. The IKDC radiological grades in the worst compartment were A = 15%, B = 51%, C = 19%, and D = 14% (n = 83). There was a significant difference between the injured versus contralat...

TI  - How to Improve the Prediction of Quadrupled Semitendinosus and Gracilis Autograft Sizes With Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Ultrasonography
PY  - 2013
AB  - Background:Hamstring tendon grafts may have an unacceptable size for use in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been proposed to predict the diameters of hamstring tendon grafts.Hypothesis:Preoperative ultrasonography (US) might reliably anticipate intraoperative 4-strand semitendinosus and gracilis tendon (4ST-GT) graft sizes similarly to MRI. An MRI evaluation of the hamstring tendons with a higher magnification may improve the accuracy of the method.Study Design:Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2.Methods:A total of 33 patients undergoing ACL reconstruction with a 4ST-GT graft and MRI performed at our institution were included. The cross-sectional area (CSA) of each semitendinosus tendon (ST) and gracilis tendon (GT) was calculated preoperatively with US and with MRI under 2× and 4× magnification. Intraoperative measurement of the final diameter of the 4ST-GT using a closed-hole sizing block with 0.5-mm increments was made. Pearson correlatio...

TI  - Single-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Biomechanical Cadaveric Study of a Rectangular Quadriceps and Bone–Patellar Tendon–Bone Graft Configuration Versus a Round Hamstring Graft
PY  - 2013
AB  - Purpose The purposes of this study were to investigate anterior tibial translation under loading conditions after single-bundle (SB) anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using a rectangular tunnel placement strategy with quadriceps and bone–patellar tendon–bone (BPTB) graft and to compare these data with a SB hamstring reconstruction with a round tunnel design. Methods In 9 human cadaveric knees, the knee kinematics were examined with robotic/universal force-moment sensor testing. Within the same specimen, the knee kinematics under simulated pivot-shift and KT-1000 arthrometer (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA) testing were determined at 0°, 15°, 30°, 60°, and 90° of flexion under different conditions: intact knee, ACL-deficient knee, and SB ACL-reconstructed knee. For the SB ACL-reconstructed knee, 3 different SB reconstruction techniques were used: a rectangular tunnel strategy (9 × 5 mm) with quadriceps graft, a rectangular tunnel strategy with BPTB graft, and a round tunnel strategy (7 mm) with hamstring graft. Results In a simulated Lachman test, a statistically significant difference was found at 0° and 15° of knee flexion between the rectangular reconstruction with quadriceps graft (5.1 ± 1.2 mm and 8.3 ± 2 mm, respectively) or BPTB graft (5.3 ± 1.5 mm and 8 ± 1.9 mm, respectively) and the reconstruction using hamstring graft (7.2 ± 1.4 mm and 12 ± 1.8 mm, respectively) ( P  = .032 and P  = .033, respectively, at 0°; P  = .023 and P  = .02, respectively, at 15°). On the simulated pivot-shift test at 0° and 15°, rectangular ACL reconstruction with quadriceps graft (3.9 ± 2.1 mm and 6.5 ± 1.7 mm, respectively) or BPTB graft (4.2 ± 1.8 mm and 6.7 ± 1.7 mm, respectively) showed a significantly lower anterior tibial translation when compared with round tunnel reconstruction (5.5 ± 2.1 mm and 7.9 ± 1.9 mm, respectively) ( P  = .03 and P  = .041, respectively, at 0°; P  = .042 and P  = .046, respectively, at 15°). Conclusions Under simulated Lachman testing and pivot-shift testing, a reconstruction technique using a rectangular tunnel results in significantly lower anterior tibial translation at 0° and 15° of flexion in comparison to knees reconstructed with a hamstring SB graft using a round tunnel strategy. Clinical Relevance ACL reconstruction with a rectangular tunnel and BPTB and quadriceps tendon might result in better anterior knee stability at low flexion angles than ACL reconstruction with hamstring SB graft and a round tunnel in the clinical setting.

TI  - Long-Term Results of ACL Reconstruction Using a Nonanatomic Double-Bundle Technique with Extra-Articular Reinforcement.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Extra-articular procedures for the improvement in rotational stability after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction have gained popularity in the last decade. This surgical gesture hoped to improve resistance to the high tensional forces affecting the ACL graft during cutting and pivoting movements of the lower extremity and eventually prevent ACL reconstruction failure. We performed this study to analyze the long-term results of patients undergoing ACL reconstruction using a nonanatomic double-bundle technique with an additional extra-articular augmentation. All the cases that underwent an ACL reconstruction using a nonanatomic double-bundle technique with an extra-articular reinforcement during the period between 1992 and 1997 were reviewed. The inclusion criteria for this study included a minimum follow-up of 10 years and age between 14 and 45 years at the time of the surgery. Forty patients were included in this series (34 males and 6 females). The mean Lysholm score after a minimum follow-up period of 10 years was 92.3 (standard deviation [SD], 9.4). The average preoperative Tegner score of the participants was 7.0 (SD, 1.1). This score decreased to 5.7 (SD, 1.2) at the end of follow-up. Follow-up X-rays were reviewed to assess the degenerative changes in the three knee compartments. Degenerative changes ≥ Kellgren–Lawrence grade 2 were observed in our six (15%) patients, all of them in the medial knee compartment. With these results, we conclude that double-bundle nonanatomic ACL reconstruction combined with an extra-articular reinforcement resembling the anterolateral ligament offers good overall long-term results, with relatively low rates of osteoarthritis.

TI  - Predictors of Radiographic Knee Osteoarthritis After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction
PY  - 2011
AB  - Background: Evidence suggests that single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction does not reliably prevent the development of knee osteoarthritis (OA).Purpose: This study was conducted to determine the overall prevalence of and risk factors for the development of radiographic knee OA after single-bundle ACL reconstruction.Study Design: Case control study; Level of evidence, 3.Methods: There were 249 individuals who had undergone primary single-bundle ACL reconstruction included in this retrospective cohort study. Follow-up radiographs were scored by a single orthopaedic surgery sports medicine fellow using the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) scale to determine the degree of OA in the medial, lateral, and patellofemoral compartments. Radiographic OA of the involved knee was considered to be present if, compared with the noninvolved knee, there was at least a 2-grade difference in the KL score in at least 1 compartment or a 1-grade difference in at least 2 compartments. Predictors of OA that were exp...

TI  - Can tape-screw fixation of a quadrupled semitendinosus graft in a full-length tibial tunnel provide superior fixation compared with a doubled semitendinosus-gracilis held with an interference screw? A matched-pair cadaveric biomechanical comparison.
PY  - 2018
AB  - In anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, quadrupled semitendinosus (Quad ST) grafts have potential advantages over doubled semitendinosus–gracilis (ST/G) including larger diameter and gracilis preservation, however the ideal tibial fixation method of the resultant shorter Quad ST graft remains elusive if a fixed-loop suspensory fixation device is used on the femur. We investigated whether the tibial fixation biomechanical properties of a Quad ST fixed indirectly with polyethylene terephthalate tape tied over a screw in a full outside-in created tunnel was superior to a ST/G graft fixed with an interference screw. In a controlled laboratory study, six cadaveric matched pairs of each construct were subjected to cyclic loading to mimic physiologic loading during rehabilitation. This included preconditioning cycling, cyclic loading to 220 N for 500 cycles, then cyclic loading to 500 N for 500 cycles. High standard deviations across the measured parameters occurred with no significant difference between measured parameters of elongation for the different constructs. Elongation of the Quad-ST construct was greater at 10 and 100 cycles, but not statistically different. Four of the six Quad-ST constructs failed below 100 cycles, compared with two failures below 100 cycles in the ST/G construct. There was a strong correlation between cycles to failure and bone mineral density for the Quad ST-tape constructs. Tibial fixation of Quad ST with a tied tape–screw construct in a full-length tunnel was not biomechanically superior to ST/G graft fixed with an interference screw, exhibited greater nonsignificant construct elongation with earlier failure, and was more reliant on bone mineral density. In vitro laboratory study.

TI  - Incidence and Predictors of Second Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury After Primary Reconstruction and Return to Sport
PY  - 2015
AB  - An estimated 200 000 anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries occur annually in the United States,1,2 with as many as 90% of patients electing to undergo ACL reconstruction (ACLR).3 Despite the high prevalence of surgery after ACL injury, outcomes vary widely in the literature. Recent evidence suggests that more than 50% of athletes are unable to return to their preinjury level of function after ACLR4 and between 50% and 100% develop knee osteoarthritis within 5 to 10 years of surgery.5,6 Considering the high rate of poor outcomes after primary ACLR, we must be very concerned that a large proportion of athletes who have undergone ACLR ultimately suffer a second ACL injury. Future directions in the management of ACL injury after ACLR must focus on prevention. Prior success using an injury-prevention model7,8 to decrease the rate of primary ACL injury may have important applications in this population.

TI  - Long-term follow-up after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a press-fit quadriceps tendon-patellar bone autograft.
PY  - 2018
AB  - The use of a quadriceps tendon-patellar bone (QTPB) autograft provides an alternative procedure in primary reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Using the press-fit technique for femoral fixation and knotting over a bone bridge as well as additional spongiosa filling for tibial fixation can completely eliminate the need for fixation implants. The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term clinical, functional and radiological results of this operating method. Sixty-nine patients (27 female-42 male) were included in this study. Fifty-seven patients (83%) received a comprehensive follow-up review after an average period of 7.5 years (range: 7–8.7). All other patients were surveyed by telephone. Six patients (9%) suffered a re-rupture of the ACL graft caused by a new related trauma and were therefore excluded from the statistical analysis. Of all patients, 98% were satisfied with the operation. Normal or almost normal results were recorded in the subjective IKDC scores form by 88% of the patients. The Lysholm score demonstrated very good and good results in 83% of the patients. Only 1 patient reported minor complaints in the donor area. Seven (12%) patients developed Cyclops syndrome with limited knee extension. This complication was treated arthroscopically within the first year postoperatively. Their results on follow-up were not worse than the results of the patients without Cyclops syndrome. Regarding the 57 patients who received a comprehensive evaluation, the stability test with the KT-1000 Arthrometer yielded a difference of less than 3 mm in the contralateral comparison for 89% of the operated knees. The pivot-shift test was normal in 79% and almost normal in 21%. In the Single-leg Triple Hop Test, patients achieved an average of 98% of the hopping distance attained with the contralateral leg. The radiological examination revealed a slight deterioration in the Kellgren-Lawrence Score in 2 patients. The ACL reconstruction using the QTPB autograft performed with the press-fit technique leads to good results in comparison with published results of established procedures for primary ACL surgery using other autografts. Further investigations should involve comparative studies with the objective of providing evidence-based, individually adapted therapy for ACL rupture.

TI  - Is Double-Bundle ACL Reconstruction Necessary?
PY  - 2012
AB  - The surgical technique for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction has evolved through the years, and the results with using various graft sources, such as a hamstring tendon graft, patellar tendon graft, or allograft, have varied considerably. An open technique for ACL surgery using an ipsilateral patellar tendon graft was the gold standard for ACL surgery in the 1980s. Stability was predictably obtained, but lack of knee range of motion and donor site morbidity was common enough for surgeons that they sought other graft sources and different surgical techniques. There was a shift to arthroscopically assisted ACL reconstruction, but knee stiffness and donor site morbidity problems persisted.

TI  - Managing Knee Injuries: Keeping Up With Changes
PY  - 2012
AB  - The knee is one of the most frequently injured joints in the human body, with the treatment of knee injuries representing a significant portion of physical therapists' and orthopaedic physicians' clinical practice. Consequently, the knee is also one of the most frequently studied and written-about joints in the literature. So why publish a special issue on the knee when it is already so frequently discussed in the literature? The main reason is that things change, and certainly things are changing rapidly in the treatment of specific knee lesions. Also, the sheer volume of literature on surgical techniques and rehabilitation concepts makes it a challenge for any clinician to remain up to date. It is therefore the intent of this special issue to provide clinicians with key updates on the management of selected knee injuries.

TI  - Patient and surgical characteristics that affect revision risk in dynamic intraligamentary stabilization of the anterior cruciate ligament.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Failure of dynamic intraligamentary stabilization (DIS) that requires revision surgery of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) has not been studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of revision ACL surgery, and the patient characteristics and surgery-related factors that are associated with an increased risk of ACL revision after DIS. This study analysed a prospective, consecutively documented single-centre case series using standardized case report forms over a 2.5-year follow-up period. The primary endpoint was revision ACL surgery. We used Kaplan–Meier analysis to examine the revision-free survival time, and a multiple logistic regression model of potential risk factors including age, sex, BMI, smoking status, previous contralateral ACL injury, Tegner activity score, interval to surgery, rupture pattern, hardware removal, and postoperative side-to-side difference in knee laxity. Relative risk was calculated for subgroups of significant risk factors. In total, 381 patients (195 male) with a mean age of 33 ± 12 years were included in the analysis. The incidence of revision ACL surgery was 30/381 (7.9%). Younger age (p = 0.001), higher Tegner activity score (p = 0.003), and increased knee laxity (p = 0.015) were significantly associated with revision ACL surgery. The increased relative risk for patients who were less than 24 years old, participated in activities at a Tegner level >5 points, or had >2 mm of side-to-side difference in knee laxity was 1.6, 3.7, and 2.3, respectively. Young age, high level of sport activity, and high knee laxity observed in follow-up examinations increased the likelihood for revision surgery after DIS. Patients undergoing DIS should be informed of their potentially increased risk for therapy failure and carefully monitored during recovery. Case series, Level IV.

TI  - Mechanical Methods of Producing Biomaterials with Aligned Collagen Fibrils
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Collagen has been used in various therapeutic medical devices, such as artificial dermis, bone, and cartilage, wherein the effectiveness of collagen mainly depends on its biological features of biocompatibility, biodegradability, bioresorbability, cell affinity, and weak antigenicity. Collagen is the main structural protein in the human body and is responsible for the mechanical properties of tissues and organs. The fundamental structural component of tendon tissue is uniaxially aligned collagen fibrils that run parallel to the geometrical axis. Thus, the fabrication of artificial tendons is an excellent example of developing biomaterials using collagen as a structural backbone. Previous attempts to construct aligned fibril-based biomaterials involved electrospinning, freeze drying, using a strong magnetic field, and mechanical methods, including shearing and tension during wet extrusion. Among these, mechanical methods have been extensively studied owing to their simplicity and effectiveness suitable for mass production. However, few review articles have focused on these mechanical methods. Thus, this article reviews the mechanical methods for creating biomaterials from aligned collagen fibril while discussing the other fabrication methods in brief.</jats:p>

TI  - The effect of progressive eccentric and concentric training on functional performance after autogenous hamstring anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a randomized controlled study
PY  - 2014
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the functional results of an early onset progressive eccentric and concentric training in patients with autogen hamstring anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Methods: Thirty-three patients with autogenous hamstring ACL reconstruction were randomly divided into study (n=16, mean age; 33.87±8.19) and control (n=17, mean age; 32.64±8.21) groups and followed the same ACL rehabilitation program. Additionally, the study group followed a progressive eccentric and concentric training for 12 weeks on the Monitorized Functional Squat System (MFSS) beginning 3 weeks after surgery. The groups were compared according to the isokinetic strength of the knee extensors and flexors, functional performance (the vertical jump test, a single hop for distance test) and the Lysholm knee scale, the Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Quality of Life Questionnaire (ACL-QOL), before and 16 weeks after the surgery. Results: The functional outcomes in terms of the vertical jump test (p=0.012), a single hop-for-distance test (p=0.027), the Lysholm knee scale (p=0.002) and the ACL-QOL questionnaire (p=0.000) demonstrated significantly greater improvement in the study group. No significant difference was reported between groups for isokinetic strength of the knee extensors and flexors (p>0.05). Conclusion: Adding progressive eccentric and concentric exercises to the standard rehabilitation protocol may improve the functional results after ACL reconstruction with autogen hamstring grafts

TI  - Anatomic Risk Factors for Initial and Secondary Noncontact Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury: A Prospective Cohort Study in 880 Female Elite Handball and Soccer Players.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is one of the most severe injuries for athletes. It is important to identify risk factors because a better understanding of injury causation can help inform athletes about risk and increase their understanding of and motivation for injury prevention.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">To investigate the relationship between anatomic factors and risk for future noncontact ACL injuries.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A total of 870, excluding 9 players with a new contact ACL injury and a player with a new noncontact ACL injury just before the testing, female elite handball and soccer players-86 of whom had a history of ACL injury-underwent measurements of anthropometrics, alignment, joint laxity, and mobility, including leg length, knee alignment, knee anteroposterior laxity, generalized joint hypermobility, genu recurvatum, and hip anteversion. All ACL injuries among the tested players were recorded prospectively. Welch <i>t</i> tests and chi-square tests were used for comparison between the groups (new injury group, which sustained a new ACL injury in the follow-up period, and no new injury group).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">An overall 64 new noncontact ACL injuries were registered. No differences were found between athletes with and without a new ACL injury among most of the measured variables. However, static knee valgus was significantly higher in the new injury group than in the no new injury group among all players (mean difference [MD], 0.9°; <i>P</i> = .007), and this tendency was greater in players with a previous ACL injury (MD, 2.1°; <i>P</i> = .002). Players with secondary injury also had a higher degree of knee hyperextension when compared with those previously injured who did not have a secondary injury (MD, 1.6°; <i>P</i> = .007).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The anatomic factors that we investigated had a weak or no association with risk for an index noncontact ACL injury. Increased static knee valgus was associated with an increased risk for noncontact ACL injury, in particular for secondary injury. Furthermore, hyperextension of the knee was a risk factor for secondary ACL injury.</AbstractText>

TI  - Isokinetic knee flexor strength after acl reconstruction with hamstring tendon autograft
PY  - 2013
AB  - Purpose: The aim of our study was to examine the knee flexors torque in patients with ruptured anterior cruciate ligament, treated with quadrupled single bundle hamstrings autograft at more than two years after operation. Material-Methods: 35 patients, (22 male and 13 female), aged between 17 and 44 years (av.28), were subjected to flexion and extension isokinetic measurements, at least 24 months after ACL reconstruction using hamstrings quadruple autograft. The isokinetic dynamometer Con-Trex MJ was used, at angular velocities 60°/ sec and 120°/sec. The findings were compared to healthy side. Results: At 60°/sec, the average Torqional Moment for Flexion (TMF) was 96.5 Nm, for the operated side and 110.8 Nm for the healthy side. At 120°/sec, the corresponding average values were 94.3 and 108.1 Nm. The Extension Torquional Moment, (TME), average values were at 60°/sec 187.2 Nm for the operated side and 197.3 Nm for the contralateral side. At 120°/sec, the TME av. value was 182.1 Νm for the operated side and 186.9 Nm for the healthy side. No statistically significant difference was detected at the TMF and TME values between the 60°/sec and 120°/sec angular velocities. The Limb Symmetry Index (LSI), for flexion was over 90% in only 19 patients (54%), while the average was 84.8%. LSI for extension was over 90% in 27 patients (78%), while the average was 92.3%. The Hamstrings/Quadriceps ratio (H/Q) was average 0.64 for the operated and 0.77 for the healthy leg. Conclusions: 24 months after ACL reconstruction with hamstrings, significant defect of flexion power still exists.

TI  - Arthrometric curve-shape variables to assess anterior cruciate ligament deficiency
PY  - 2012
AB  - article i nfo Background: Instrumented measurement of asymmetry in anterior-posterior knee laxity is commonly used to assess anterior cruciate ligament integrity. Significant advances in arthrometric technology and data visualiza- tion have occurred since first generation arthrometers. However, little has changed with regard to diagnostic criteria employed. To our knowledge, no investigations have assessed the shape of laxity curves to diagnose anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) deficiency. We hypothesized that linear stiffness and compliance after positive curve inflection would be more sensitive and specific to anterior cruciate ligament injury than current measures and would require data from the involved limb only.

TI  - The Bone Bridge for Tibial ACL Graft Fixation: A Biomechanical Analysis of Different Tibial Fixation Methods for ACL Reconstruction.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="Background" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The tibial fixation site is considered the weak link in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, and conflicting results regarding the biomechanical properties of various fixation methods have been reported.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Purpose" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">To examine knots tied over a bone bridge and its biomechanical properties as a suitable tibial fixation method in ACL reconstruction.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Study Design" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Controlled laboratory study.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">We divided 40 fresh-frozen porcine tibiae into 4 equal groups to evaluate flexor tendon grafts set with standard tibial fixation techniques: (1) bone bridge (BB group), (2) suspension button (SB group), (3) combined interference screw and bone bridge (IFS/BB group), and (4) combined interference screw and suspension button (IFS/SB group). Each construct was subjected to cyclic loading (1500 cycles, 50-250 N, 1 Hz) with a servohydraulic materials testing machine to measure elongation; load-to-failure testing (displacement rate: 25 mm/s) was then performed. Load to failure, stiffness, and yield load were compared between constructs using 1-way analysis of variance.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The hybrid fixation constructs (IFS/BB and IFS/SB groups) showed significantly better biomechanical properties than the isolated extracortical fixation constructs (BB and SB groups) (<i>P</i> &lt; .05 for all). There were no differences between the isolated extracortical fixation constructs or between the hybrid fixation constructs in elongation or load to failure; however, stiffness of the IFS/BB group was significantly higher than that of the IFS/SB group (175.3 ± 16.6 vs 144.9 ± 20.1 N/mm, respectively; <i>P</i> &lt; .05). Stiffness between the SB and BB groups was not significantly different.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Conclusion" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Hybrid fixation had superior biomechanical performance compared with isolated extracortical fixation. However, tibial graft fixation using a bone bridge either as isolated extracortical fixation or combined with an interference screw for hybrid fixation showed equivalent biomechanical properties compared with suspension button-based graft fixation.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Clinical Relevance" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The clinical use of a bone bridge for tibial graft fixation could reduce the cost for ACL reconstruction and lower the rate of implant-associated issues.</AbstractText>

TI  - Greater muscle co-contraction results in increased tibiofemoral compressive forces in females who have undergone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Individuals who have undergone ACL reconstruction (ACLR) have been shown to have a higher risk of developing knee osteoarthritis (OA). The elevated risk of knee OA may be associated with increased tibiofemoral compressive forces. The primary purpose of this study was to examine whether females with ACLR demonstrate greater tibiofemoral compressive forces, as well as greater muscle co-contraction and decreased knee flexion during a single-leg drop-land task when compared to healthy females. Ten females with ACLR and 10 healthy females (control group) participated. Each participant underwent two data collection sessions: (1) MRI assessment and (2) biomechanical analysis (EMG, kinematics, and kinetics) during a single-leg drop-land task. Joint kinematics, EMG, and MRI-measured muscle volumes and patella tendon orientation were used as input variables into a MRI-based EMG-driven knee model to quantify the peak tibiofemoral compressive forces during landing. Peak tibiofemoral compressive forces were significantly higher in the ACLR group when compared to the control group (97.3 ± 8.0 vs. 88.8 ± 9.8 N · kg(-1)). The ACLR group also demonstrated significantly greater muscle co-contraction as well as less knee flexion than the control group. Our findings support the premise that individuals with ACLR demonstrate increased tibiofemoral compression as well as greater muscle co-contraction and decreased knee flexion during a drop-land task. Future studies are needed to examine whether correcting abnormal neuromuscular strategies and reducing tibiofemoral compressive forces following ACLR can slow the progression of joint degeneration in this population.

TI  - Risks of Future Joint Arthritis and Reinjury After ACL Reconstruction
PY  - 2018
AB  - This chapter discusses long-term data from ACL reconstruction studies, the factors that are most likely related to increased risk of developing arthritis, and causes of failure of surgery. While data from most ACL reconstruction studies show favorable results in terms of improved knee stability and function, the outcome in terms of prevalence of osteoarthritis in long-term studies is highly variable. Factors that may cause eventual knee arthritis include meniscectomy, abnormal knee kinematics, severe bone bruising, damage to other knee ligament structures, alteration in the biochemical environment, chondral fractures or lesions, excessive uncorrected varus or valgus lower limb malalignment, obesity, genetics, and long-term participation in high-impact sports activities. The problem exists that ACL reconstruction does not fully restore normal knee kinematics, despite advanced surgical procedures and rehabilitation. The published rates of either reinjuring an ACL-reconstructed knee or sustaining an ACL rupture on the contralateral knee upon return to activities after surgery vary widely from 2 to 30%.

TI  - Long-term outcome of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with an autologous four-strand semitendinosus tendon autograft
PY  - 2013
AB  - Although the short- and mid-term outcomes of ACL reconstruction with a hamstring graft are promising, clinical investigations reporting the long-term results after ten years or longer are rare. Therefore we performed a retrospective single-blinded evaluation of ACL reconstruction using a four-stranded single-bundle reconstruction with a semitendinosus tendon graft with extracortical fixation. At follow-up patients obtained at least the same level in the clinical outcome scores (Lysholm, IKDC, Tegner) compared to previous studies with a similar follow-up time using a STG graft. Furthermore there was no detectable difference in the incidence of osteoarthritis. Patients having a negative pivot shift test showed significantly fewer signs of radiographic osteoarthritis and better functional assessment scores. On the basis of our investigation, we conclude that the reconstruction of the ACL by a quadrupled semitendinosus tendon graft with extracortical anchorage can achieve excellent clinical and subjective results after a follow-up of ten years.

TI  - Peracetic acid sterilized tendon and ligament allografts for knee reconstruction : For anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and complex knee surgery.
PY  - 2024
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">The use of allografts and autografts has been met with mixed views on whether allografts are a suitable alternative to autografts.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="QUESTION" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">We aimed to investigate if chemically sterilized allografts show similar rerupture rates to those reported in the literature for allografts and autografts in anterior (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligaments (PCL) and complex knee surgery.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="MATERIALS AND METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Retrospective data on knee reconstructions performed between 2011 and 2015 with tendon/ligamnet allografts sterilized with peracetic acid were collected in the form of a questionnaire. The inclusion criteria of 2 years for each patient were met by 38 patients, representing 22 ACL reconstructions, 5 PCL reconstructions, 3 OTHER surgeries, including the Larson technique and medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction and 8 COMPLEX surgeries. The main endpoints were rerupture and complication rate. Secondary endpoints included stability of the knee (Lachman test, Pivot shift test) and the range of motion.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The rerupture rate was 7.9% (3 grafts). Reruptures only occurred in the ACL group. No reruptures were observed in the PCL, OTHER and COMPLEX surgery groups. Stability improved significantly after surgery and the range of motion returned to values similar to that of healthy knees.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Tendon allografts sterilized with peracetic acid show promising low rerupture rates and good clinical scores and the results are comparable to the literature on autografts and other allografts.</AbstractText>

TI  - The Effects of a Combined Pre- and Post-Operative Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Rehabilitation Program on Lower Extremity Muscle Imbalance
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>This study examined whether the 5-week pre-operative progressive exercise rehabilitation program with weekly monitoring contributed to a significantly lower muscle activity imbalance in the treatment group, both before and immediately after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), as well as during the next 5 weeks in comparison to the control group. Twelve professional soccer players took part in the study (from among the top three Polish levels of competition) (age: 26 ± 5 years, body mass: 73 ± 7 kg, stature: 180 ± 6 cm, training experience: 15 ± 4 years). The participants were randomly assigned to the treatment group (n = 6) or to the control group (n = 6). Both groups performed the same pre- and post-operative progressive exercise rehabilitation program, while the rehabilitation of the treatment group was extended by supplementary body-weight functional stabilization training. The three-way repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a statistically significant interaction for muscle × group × time (p &lt; 0.0001; F = 24.897; η2 = 0.806). The post-hoc analysis for the interaction effect of muscle × group × time indicated a significantly higher muscle activity imbalance for every measured muscle in the control group at any time point than in the treatment group (from p = 0.036 to p &lt; 0.0001). The muscle activity imbalance was significantly higher from the 1st to 4th weeks than in the last week before surgery for quadriceps (p &lt; 0.016 for all) and hamstrings (p &lt; 0.001). However, in the case of gluteal muscles’ activity imbalance, it was significantly higher at every time point of the post-operative phase than in the last week before surgery (p &lt; 0.001). The results of this study showed that the 5-week pre-operative rehabilitation program with weekly monitoring influenced outcomes of the post-operative phase. Nevertheless, performing both pre- and post-ACLR rehabilitation significantly reduced the muscle activity imbalance of lower limbs, but in the case of the quadriceps muscles, not to a sufficient level.</jats:p>

TI  - Role of Physiotherapy in Preventing Failure of Primary Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction
PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract Background/Purpose Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is routinely performed in sports medicine. We aimed to determine if there is any protective effect of postoperative physiotherapy in preventing graft rupture after primary ACL reconstruction (ACLR). Methods A retrospective case–control study was carried out, with demographic data, concomitant meniscal injury, and intraoperative fixation methods matched. The number of sessions of physiotherapy attended by the rupture group and nonrupture group were compared using binary logistic regression. Results No significant relationship between the frequency of postoperative physiotherapy and occurrence of graft rupture after primary ACLR was identified. Conclusion Further research is needed to verify the effect of physiotherapy in the prevention of graft rupture after primary ACLR.

TI  - Long-term results after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using patellar tendon versus hamstring tendon autograft with a minimum follow-up of 10 years-a systematic review.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="INTRODUCTION" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">A lot of research addresses superiority of the two commonly used autografts bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) and hamstring tendon for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, without getting to consensus. While there are numerous studies and reviews on short- to mid-term follow-up, not much literature is available on long-term follow-up. As patients suffering ACL injuries are often of young age and high athletic activity, it is crucial to have the best evidence possible for graft choice to minimize consequences, like osteoarthritis later on.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="MATERIALS AND METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">A search of the online databases, PubMed and Embase, was carried out last on 31st March 2022 for studies comparing BPTB and hamstring tendon (HT) autografts for ACL reconstruction in human patients with a minimum follow-up of 10 years. The methodological quality of each study has been evaluated using the modified Coleman Methodology Score. Results on the three variables patient-oriented outcomes, clinical testing and measurements and radiographic outcomes were gathered and are presented in this review.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Of 1299 records found, nine studies with a total of 1833 patients were identified and included in this systematic review. The methodological quality of the studies ranged from a Coleman Score of 63-88. Many studies reported no or only few statistically significant differences. Significant results in favour of BPTB were found for activity levels and for instrumented laxity testing with the KT-1000 arthrometer. Better outcomes for HT were found in IKDC-SKF, the KOOS, donor site morbidity, pivot shift test, radiographic osteoarthritis (IKDC C or D) and contralateral ACL rupture. No studies presented significant differences in terms of Lysholm Score or Tegner Activity Score, Lachman test, single-legged hop test, deficits in range of motion, osteoarthritis using the Kellgren and Lawrence classification or graft rupture.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">We cannot recommend one graft to be superior, since both grafts show disadvantages in the long-term follow-up. Considering the limitation of our systematic review of no quantitative analysis, we cannot draw further conclusions from the many insignificant results presented by individual studies.</AbstractText>
